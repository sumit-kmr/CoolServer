He then made a precise aalapana of Bahudari followed by the krithi \u2018Gurupavanalaya\u2019 of Sundaranarayana. \u2018Jalajanabha\u2019 (Kedaragowla) and \u2018Paalayamadhava\u2019 (Asaveri), both composed by Swathi, were marked by the beauty of the leisurely pace with which they were delivered. The latter was decorated with an array of swara passages with a judicious mix of Jhanda patterns. \u2018Pahitharakshu\u2019 (Anandabhairavi) of Swathi was executed in a slow tempo setting the stage for main piece. A neat alapana of Sreeranjini panning its contours preceded the main piece \u2014 \u2018Bhavaye Sree Janaki Kantham\u2019, which was decked with niraval and swara passages.

However, instead of concentrating on the krithis of Swati, he chose to sing several other compositions. The solo presentation of Valachi and Saramathi by violinist Viju S Anand were praiseworthy and the deft handling with delicate touches by Palakkad A M Harinarayanan on the mridangam was commendable.

She took off with a rarely-heard \u2018Sree Ramachandra\u2019 (Thodi) enriched with swara passages followed by \u2018Jaya Jaya Padmanabhanujesa\u2019 (Manirangu). Malayamarutham blossomed with a pretty aalapana and the krithi \u2018Padmanabhapaalithebha\u2019 was tagged on to it. After the padavarnam \u2018Sumasayaka\u2019, she took Hamsanandi for elaboration with full vigour especially in the higher echelons and experimented with sruthibhedam at rishabham to create Hindolam for a while. \u2018Paahijagadjanani\u2019 was the krithi rendered. \u2018Bhavayami\u2019 was the main piece and she devoted time to elaborate all the seven ragas before garlanding the krithi with several cycles of ragamalika swara phrases. \u2018Saramaina\u2019 (Behag) and \u2018Panimathi\u2019 (Ahiri) constituted the post-thani session.

Exposition of Lalithapanchamam by Anand before the krithi \u2018Paramapurusham\u2019 and Shanmukhapriya by Kannan preluding \u2018Maamavakarunaya\u2019 were well portrayed. Chakravakam was detailed before the main piece \u2018Sarojanabha\u2019, which was followed by Thani. \u2018Aaaye Giridhar\u2019 (Puryadhanasree) and thillana brought their concert to a close.\n\nA Kathakali pada kacheri comprising padams of female characters from select plays was led by P D Narayanan Namboothiri and Kalamandalam Vinod. \u2018Sree Neelakanda\u2019 (\u2018Dakshayagam\u2019) in Neelambari, \u2018Anupamagunanakum\u2019 (\u2018Lavanasuravadham\u2019) in Reethigowla, \u2018Saamyamakannoru\u2019 (\u2018Nalacharitham\u2019) in Panthuvarali were presented.

Cameron Johnson, Director of Product \u2014 TV & Kids, tells us about the UX decisions and the timing of this shuffle feature\n\nOver the last year, binge-watching evolved from something recreational and occasionally addictive to something mediated into our daily routines as we work from home. But one thing remained universal: its ability to dismantle the foundations of traditional television peppered with advertisements and a finite schedule.\n\n(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nNetflix has obviously pioneered this entertainment revolution, and the streaming company continues to innovate its interface and experience to keep users hooked and in control of what they want to watch. And then there are new features such as Play Something launching globally on April 28 across television interfaces.\n\nIn an exclusive interview over a video call from California, Cameron Johnson, Director of Product \u2014 TV & Kids, avers that at the core, Internet TV is all about empowering the user with control. \u201cFor the previous 70 years, we were at the whim of what the broadcaster wanted us to watch on, say, a Tuesday evening. Internet TV has broadened that with titles from thousands of channels,\u201d he explains.\n\nHe adds, \u201cHowever, with so many choices comes the need to make a choice; a lot of times that is straightforward especially when it\u2019s the next episode of a series. But there are other times when the user or users want to watch something new but are not sure what that is. Play Something is a great marriage of our personalisation technologies; we are not choosing something randomly, we are choosing something based on your taste and watch history.\u201d\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThere are three different ways to access Play Something. The first is a specialised button at the profile selection screen; which Johnson says is \u201cideal for those moments after you\u2019ve just cooked dinner and you want to watch something immediately without having to choose.\u201d\n\nThe second way is to access the app menu which is typically on the left of the screen, where there would be a Play Something option. The last one is a little more intuitive; as the user scrolls and browses further down the films and series options, a tile will come up with an option to Play Something, as if Netflix senses a little indecision.\n\nInto the tech Netflix\u2019s personalisation technologies are powered by Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and a family of ranking algorithms. Netflix is accelerating the pace of algorithm innovation by putting together a two-stage online experimentation process. The first stage is a fast-pruning step in which the company identifies the most promising ranking algorithms from a large initial set of ideas. The second stage is a traditional \u2018A or B\u2019 test on the pared-down set of algorithms to measure their impact on longer-term member behaviour.\n\nThe user experience (UX) is something Netflix wanted to keep quite simple in terms of design, with as much screen space going to the title playing for a short time. This tile also has left and right arrows so the users can switch between recommendations offered up to them. There may also be an indicator text at the lower part of the Play Something tile, such as \u2018We think you\u2019ll like this classic TV show\u2019 or \u2018This is a block-buster movie like Spider-Man Homecoming.\u2019\n\n\u201cIf the title is for mature audiences, the feature will inform you beforehand so you have the opportunity to make a more informed decision,\u201d adds Johnson, \u201cbut after 30 seconds of playing the recommendation, the layer of Play Something fades away. But the user can always exit this feature.\u201d\n\nDesigning the feature entailed a lot of iteration and testing, says Johnson. \u201cWe understood early on that the design element should be kept as simple and accessible as possible. The UX journey\u2019s many iterations led to the final decision to ensure users know they\u2019re in a mode where they can switch. It\u2019s meant to be evocative of traditional TV\u2019s channel changing, with the same simplicity.\u201d\n\nJohnson also clarifies it is important the user is given information about why they received a certain recommendation, to draw a basic connect-the-dots.\n\nAccessibility in design is integral; Johnson and his team ensured it was a feature that those who are not very tech savvy would be able to navigate the feature with no fuss. \u201cIt is part of the Kids\u2019 section too,\u201d adds Johnson. \u201cOne of the things we know about kids is \u2014 and I have a 10 year old daughter and a 7 year old son \u2014 they tend to watch the same show over and over again. My son loves Pokemon, in particular, so getting them to watch something new can be hard. But my son loves Play Something because of that \u2018mystery box\u2019 element, so for him and other kids, it is a form of discovery of new content.\u201d\n\nA cut above\n\nEarlier innovation features within Netflix include Previews, where a user can automatically play \u2018trailers\u2019 using autoplay to \u2013 literally \u2013 get a preview of a TV show or movie. Is Play Something a modification of Previews? \u201cNot exactly,\u201d responds Johnson, \u201cwhat is most significantly different is Play Something just plays the title. Previews were designed to help the user evaluate and make a choice, but this goes a step forward and makes the choice for you while still leaving the final decision up to the user \u2013 you can always opt in or out.\u201d\n\nAdditionally in August 2020, Netflix was also testing a \u2018Shuffle Play\u2019 button that also appears on the home screen. The company at the time confirmed they were testing the feature since July, explaining they test such features in different countries for varying time periods. In fact, for some users, Play Something is not entirely new; last year a few of them pointed it out being tested, particularly in the left-side menu of the TV interface.\n\nCameron Johnson, Director of Product Innovation - TV & Kids, Netflix | Photo Credit: Netflix Inc\n\nOwing to the pandemic, bringing Play Something to the television Netflix experience first was a conscious decision, agrees Johnson, as the television is often the unity point for members of a household \u2014 more than mobile phones and tablets \u2014 or after a day of work, chores, studying and more. But the natural calamity that follows everyone sitting down in front of a television is getting everyone to find a show that they will be happy to watch.\n\nOf course, in this case, it is not just one user\u2019s watch pattern, but multiple. \u201cPlay Something actually helps this decision-making faster because you just go through this list and everyone can ask \u2018are we okay with this title?\u2019 and the decision is still made by the users at the end of the day in a much shorter time,\u201d he laughs, adding he often experiences these moments of incertitude with his wife and kids in front of the TV.\n\nJohnson assures this is just the first launch of Play Something; time and more interaction with the feature will bring more iterations of the same. Is it a strategy to keep people within the Netflix experience as much as possible? Johnson says Play Something is one of many ways to resolve the frustration users feel trying to find a new title they would enjoy. He concludes, \u201cThe best part of my job is I get to make people happy with entertainment; and if that happens Netflix continues to prosper.\u201d"}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7ojpnu/article34428816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Arvinda-Avinash---Wide-Katte", "Article's Title": "A Kannada OTT platform to promote films from Karnakata", "Article's Text": "Called Katte, this platform will include Konkani and Tulu films along with music, theatre and games from every district of the state\n\nDo we need yet another OTT platform? Yes, say the Jugaari Brothers \u2014 actors Arvinda and Avinash Diwakar. The duo, grandchildren of the late Kannada actor, Naramsimharaju, has launched Katte, an OTT platform. \u201cThis will promote all the dialects of Karnataka, besides, theatre, cinema, music, games and quizes,\u201d explains Avinash, who is also a successful producer-director-singer-composer.\n\nAlso Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here\n\n\u201cThe bigger players in OTT do not understand the culture of Karnataka,\u201d says Avinash. \u201cWhen we did our research, we realised that we had enough content to put out there. Sometimes the person who heads the content division, is from a different region and looks for content that he can relate to. We were also told that the subject must have a huge social media presence. That is when we decided to do something to promote and present content for ourselves and our State, as we are losing our audience in Karnataka itself.\u201dBesides Kannada, there will also be content in Tulu, Konkani, Havyaka Uttara Karnataka, and old Mysore region dialects.\u201d\n\nAnother problem they saw was of most content being urban. \u201cThe districts, taluks, and villages are ignored. People end up watching dubbed shows and shows that are not in sync with local sentiments and culture. Katte will bridge that gap, as we will have many in-house productions that will highlight local stories.\u201d\n\nKatte means platform; the \u2018ka\u2019 stands for kathe, meaning story, and Kannada. To be launched in May, the app will be available on any device that can connect to the Internet.\n\nThe platform hopes to be a resource for little-seen actors and for directors too. \u201cIf a film fails to attract footfalls in the theatre, then it sinks into oblivion and no one outside Karnataka is interested in promoting them online. We will put up their films on Katte, so that they will be virtually available and accessible to all,\u201d says Avinash, who is the Chief Operating Officer.\n\nBreaking up the name, Avinash says, \u201cThe \u2018ka\u2019 in Katte symbolises, kathe (story), Kannada and Karnataka. Hence in one line we can say that Katte is an OTT platform for anything to do with Karnataka.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a huge gap in the entertainment sector that needed to be filled. The long-felt need for an OTT platform that exclusively caters to the needs of Karnataka\u2019s entertainment sector, that promotes local artistes will now stand fulfilled,\u201d adds Arvinda, the Chief Operating Officer Katte Entertainment Pvt Ltd\n\nBesides films and web series, bedtime stories, grandfather\u2019s tales, reality shows for children, music, Kannada stand up comedy, will all form a part of the repertoire. For instance, there is Katte Gulli Cricket is planned on the lines of IPL, but to promote local rappers and musicians, where six players from different districts will contest in gully cricket. \u201cWe have also started four centres across the State for actors and content creators to connect with us and work locally too. This way they need not travel all the way to Bengaluru,\u201d reveals Avinash, who adds, \u201cWe will also promote local rappers and musicians with a programme called Katte Gulli Cricket, where six players will play the game and contest with other districts or gullies. It will be on the lines of IPL, but will feature district or Taluk level gully cricket.\u201d\n\nAs a tribute to their grandfather, the duo has planned a series of comedy shows. Next year they also hope to organise a comedy festival as a tribute."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5esyz/article34430002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SEN0013", "Article's Title": "The Joker has a message: How Sendrayan\u2019s latest shoot came about", "Article's Text": "Actor Sendrayan believes that his \u2018Comali\u2019 photoshoot by L Ramachandran will grab eyeballs and raise awareness on the ongoing pandemic\n\nThe minute he heard the word \u2018Comali\u2019, Tamil actor Sendrayan thought of all the memorable on-screen clowns he has seen. \u201cI remembered English film Joker, Bhagyaraj sir in Rudhra and Kamal Haasan in Apoorva Sagodharargal.\u201d\n\nBut when it came to the day of shoot, he forgot them all. \u201cI posed as myself,\u201d he says. Sendrayan, a familiar face among Tamil movie buffs, is thrilled about his latest photoshoot featuring him as a clown. The photoshoot features not only the actor and a bunch of props, but also a public awareness message about the need to be safe during the second wave of COVID-19.\n\nThe photos are the brainchild of Chennai-based photographer L Ramachandran, who, along with his team comprising creative director Vidya Balaji, costume designer Sukumar and make-up artist Ilangeshwari, set on a task: to make Sendrayan look unique. \u201cWe scouted to get some colourful costumes and props,\u201d recalls Ramachandran, who recently worked with actor Vijay Sethupathi for a photoshoot.\n\nIn a bid to acknowledge the second wave of COVID-19, the team incorporated elements that would convey a safety message to viewers. \u201cWe are trying to say: the situation is bad outside, so do not be a clown and try to venture out unnecessarily,\u201d he adds.\n\nThat big step\n\nSendrayan hails from Bodinayakkanur in Theni, and came to Chennai armed with a manjapai (a yellow bag used to store personal belongings) and lots of tinseltown dreams. \u201cI remember the day I got down at the bus stand at Parry\u2019s Corner wondering how I would make ends meet in such a big city,\u201d he recalls.\n\nSince then, Sendrayan did many odd jobs before landing up at director\u2019s offices and working in various capacities. \u201cI was a production helper for some time and then became a make-up assistant,\u201d he recalls.\n\nStepping in front of the camera was a big step for Sendrayan whose first prominent outing was in Dhanush-starrer Polladhavan (2007).

And therefore, I try to do things that give me energy.\u201d Things like going over the work of 30 applicants to BAFTA Breakthrough India to \u201cnarrow down original voices that can get lost in our country of many, especially in an industry like ours where it is all about who you know,\u201d she adds.\n\nBreakthrough India is supported by Netflix and aims to select talented people in the film, games and television worlds to take part in a year-long mentoring and guidance programme. The nominees will receive global networking opportunities, free access to BAFTA events and screenings for 12 months, and full voting BAFTA membership.\n\nMira and her fellow jurors, including ambassador AR Rahman, director Shonali Bose, cinematographer Santosh Sivan and producer Siddharth Roy Kapur among others, sat down for three hours to choose the nominees. \u201cThe first thing I said was that \u2018I am looking for bravery, originality and a distinct voice, not competence, not imitation\u2019.\u201d\n\nCan you speak your truth?\n\nIn Mira\u2019s books, bravery beats competence. \u201cA lot of people can do a good imitation of art, but few have a way of capturing the world which is unique. It is how you choose to tell the story and from what point of view that defines bravery for me. That was something I saw in this lot [the nominees], they were experimental.\u201d\n\nBravery to Mira, is in the intent: \u201cthe importance of speaking your truth\u201d, in the craft: \u201cfinding new forms to tell a story\u201d, and in not being afraid to be different \u2014 \u201ceven when no one understands what you are doing.\u201d\n\nThrough her own journey into filmmaking, which started off with documentaries such as India Cabaret \u2014 an exploration of female strippers in then Bombay, Children of a Desired Sex, on the abortion of female foetuses, and The Laughing Club of India \u2014 Mira\u2019s icons have been Richard Leacock and DA Pennebaker. \u201cThey were the pioneers of the Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement and to this day, remain the barometers of truth for me,\u201d she says.\n\nShe brings up Chris Marker\u2019s La Jet\u00e9e, a science fiction-ette about post-apocalyptic experiments on humans made entirely using black and white stills. \u201cIt told me so many things about how to evoke poetry, violence and surrealism without a big budget, relying on just art and its power.\u201d\n\nAmrita and Awadh\n\nWhile movies like these are what she falls back to, Mira has also been trying to keep up with Netflix, Amazon and other OTT platforms. (Though she confides, \u201cWhat does OTT mean yaar! Over The Top? Really, it\u2019s that simple? I thought it would be more technical. Okay, I am with it now\u201d, she lets out a short bark of laughter.)\n\nHer first digital release was last year\u2019s A Suitable Boy, an adaptation of Vikram Seth\u2019s 1993 novel set in a newly independent India.\n\nWith the Government of India now stepping in to regulate content on OTT platforms, what does it mean for artistic freedom? Mira pauses thoughtfully, before replying: \u201cThe most inventive cinema has been as a response to censorship. So I hope that a lid on our heads will make us dream more.\u201d\n\nIt was when she was in Awadh, shooting A Suitable Boy, that she got her next project which would bring her back to the city. She will be adapting the 2020 Pulitzer finalist, The Jungle Prince of Delhi, a story published by The New York Times on a family living in a decrepit lodge in Delhi, claiming to be Awadh royalty.\n\nIt will be co-produced by Sister Pictures, who bankrolled the hit series Chernobyl. \u201cOf course I was interested in the story; the whole world sent it to me when it came out. I was still in Awadh then, not imagining that I would give three more years of my life to that place. I was talking to the producers to help them and advise them about the place, and they said you must direct it,\u201d she says.\n\nMeanwhile, Mira is also working on a feature film on Amrita Sher-Gil, the Hungarian-Indian painter regarded as one of the country\u2019s greatest modern artists. Her other series National Treasure on Disney+ is a reimagining of the Nicholas Cage franchise with a \u2018DREAMer\u2019 child as the protagonist. \u201cNational Treasure is in the writers room now, after a brilliant pilot. We will start shooting early next year, in January, and I hope it will be released next summer.\u201d\n\nFor The Jungle Prince however, it is still early days. \u201cIt is an operatic and ambitious story and we just found the right writers for it. It is not easy to conceive everything on Zoom, so we are waiting to gather in one place and discuss the shape of the story,\u201d she says.\n\nThe series will be told in eight episodes of an hour each. \u201cIt is such a great story. It is our story, one of trauma and exile. If we don\u2019t tell our own stories, someone else will, and mess it up,\u201d she laughs."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ewsw81/article34428754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimppuppet2jpg", "Article's Title": "Nokkuvidya Pavakali\u2019s lone practitioner", "Article's Text": "A documentary film that puts the spotlight on the form of puppet theatre in Kerala that has only one practitioner left\n\nFreelance journalist-filmmaker Reshmi Radhakrishnan first heard about Nokkuvdiya Pavakkali, a form of puppet theatre, in 2017. \u201cWhat was even more shocking or surprising was, Monipally, where the practitioners live, is barely 15-odd kilometres from my hometown, Ramapuram, in Kottayam district. And I had not heard about it,\u201d she says. Curious, she travelled to Monipally to visit one of the last two surviving practitioners of the art form: Moozhikkal Pankajakshi.\n\nAlso Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here\n\nTaken by the performance aspect, she says that the \u2018art\u2019 part of it caught her eye. Later, when she thought more about it, she realised its significance. \u201cThe art form has sociological importance; it is a Dravidian art form. The artistic aspect aside, there is the cultural part too that makes it imperative that the art form is preserved.\u201d It resulted in her 2020 documentary film Nokkuvidya, recently screened at Kochi. She earlier wrote about it.\n\nReshmi recollects her first impressions. \u201cI felt bad about what I saw there,\u201d she says. The wooden puppets were stored in a box under a bed in the house that Pankajakshi lived in with her daughter and granddaughter. \u201cIt did not look easy, looking at their means. Here they were preserving an art form despite the challenges... that struck a chord!\u201d she says.\n\nUnlike other forms of puppetry, where the puppeteer uses his hands, here the puppets are handled on a stick, balanced on the base of the nose of the puppet. Not only does it demand dexterity but also practised eye-hand co-ordination.\n\nIn this case, the puppeteer, a woman, sits on the floor and uses her hands to control the puppets, while the other group members narrate the story, invariably from The Ramayana and The Mahabharata.\n\nA lost art\n\n\u201cIt used to be performed as entertainment by members of Kerala\u2019s Velan Panicker community. Once upon a time the repertoire was not limited to puppet theatre, there were other forms such as juggling. But Nokkuvidya Pavakali is of special importance because practitioners are women. Other forms, in the past, did not allow women to touch the puppets,\u201d she says.\n\nReshmi Radhakrishnan\n\nOctogenarian Pankajakshi, a Padma Shri awardee, had been practising the artform for more than 70-odd years. Over time as practitioners dwindled, she hoped to teach to others so that the artform would live on. Unable to find anybody, she convinced her then 13-year-old granddaughter Renjini KS to be her student. Now in her early 20s, Renjini, a college student, is possibly the sole practitioner of the art form.\n\n\u201cThings are slowly changing; the troupe is being invited to perform [before COVID-19 struck]. Under the guidance of Natana Kairali (Irinjalakuda), they have been educated about the significance of the form; besides guidance promoting it,\u201d says Tripunithura-based Reshmi. A research centre for Koodiyattam, Natana Kairali also teaches Mohiniyattam, Pavakathakali, and Nangiarkoothu besides conducting workshops related to the performing arts.\n\nHer interactions with Pankajakshi, during the course of the making of the documentary, showed her another side of the artist. \u201cIt showed me how art elevates a woman, I found her very different from her contemporaries [women]. She leads a troupe that comprises men, the income and position from what she does. Her awareness of herself, in the context, was interesting.\u201d\n\nMore than as a documentary, Reshmi sees it as a resource or an archive. She spent time on research, speaking and consulting with experts such as Geetha Devi, professor at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. As this was her first experience, Reshmi turned to friends to help her with filming and the technical aspects of getting a film ready.\n\nThe documentary has been screened at festivals in India and abroad, and is still doing the rounds at the festival circuit."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/o67fl6/article34421433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thamira", "Article's Title": "Tamil director Thamira passes away due to COVID-19", "Article's Text": "He was known for his films like \u2018Rettaisuzhi\u2019and \u2018Aan Devathai\u2019\n\nTamil director Thamira passed away on Monday after suffering from COVID-19 complications at a private hospital in Chennai.

He had a crippling sense of fear when he landed in Chennai for an audition, having no prior experience nor influential people in his phonebook. He played a small part alongside actor Arya, who himself played a guest role in Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam in 2014. The scene was eventually trimmed from the film, but it gave Ashwin the confidence of making it in the industry, until he was called for an audition for Mani Ratnam\u2019s OK Kanmani (2015).\n\nAshwin had always looked up to three filmmakers: AR Murugadoss, Mani Ratnam and Gautham Menon, and the offer to be part of a Madras Talkies production [Ratnam\u2019s banner] was just the icing on the cake. But the only thing is, it was not. When he arrived for the audition, the set was crowded with over 70 well-groomed models, both male and female, who too were squeezing for space to register their presence on screen. It was only then that it dawned on Ashwin that the dream \u2014 of becoming an actor \u2014 was a shared one with perhaps hundreds. He could not make a first impression with Mani Ratnam, though he had a photo opportunity and a blink-and-miss role as a background artiste in OK Kanmani.\n\nThe second bout of disappointment hit closer when Ashwin approached Gautham Menon for an acting gig, which left the filmmaker a little miffed \u2014 especially in the manner in which he landed up at his office. Having been fooled once for a fake audition call, Ashwin says it was actor Sivakarthikeyan who advised him to look up online for director\u2019s offices and audition calls.\n\nLater, Ashwin was called for an audition and was eventually selected to play the hero\u2019s friend in a film Gautham was making at that point. As fate would have it, two days before the shoot, Ashwin was informed of Gautham\u2019s decision to cast a familiar actor in his place. Somewhere along, that is when Ashwin says he took the call: if he were to act, it would be as hero.\n\nLast year, Ashwin acted in a short-film called Kadhal Ondru Kanden, for which he received praise on social media. It got him the attention he longed for and a well-known filmmaker was ready to cast him in his film \u2014 but, as a supporting actor. The director apparently told Ashwin that he could not afford to cast him as the lead, unless he doubles up as a co-producer or has some sort of fame.\n\n\u201cThat really broke me. At the end of the day, I realised I cannot make it on my own, even if I have the talent. I kept thinking, what more should I prove to this industry? How much more should I sacrifice?\u201d says Ashwin, over a phone call, just a week after the finale of Cook with Comali, the reality television show that put him on the map.\n\nAshwin shot to fame after appearing in \u2018Cook with Comali\u2019 | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement\n\nAshwin turned to cooking purely for survival reasons, when he had no money and was living under the shelter of his friend, while trying auditions and facing rejections. \u201cI took the responsibility to cook while my friend used to do the dishes. You can even cook but dish-washing is the most difficult part,\u201d he says with a laugh. Little did he know then that what started as a basic survival skill would one day fetch him the second runner-up on a cookery show.\n\nIn this interview, Ashwin discusses his long-short journey from Coimbatore, the success of Cook with Comali, and how the industry sees him, now that the spotlight shines brightly on him.\n\nEdited excerpts:\n\nIt has been over a week since Cook with Comali ended. What is your headspace like?\n\nIt was initially hard to adjust to the routine. I went off social media and isolated myself in a room. Then, a week later, I slowly got back to my senses and started accepting things.\n\nWas it a transformative experience for you?\n\nI didn\u2019t change much, as a person. What you saw on TV is who I am in real life. Having said that, it takes time for me to open up...I\u2019m not that fluid, despite having done other shows for Vijay TV. In fact, the camera never used to linger on me because they always thought I was this quiet, shy person. People have ignored me in the past, thinking that I probably had an attitude. And I couldn\u2019t break that perception.\n\nEven on Cook with Comali, I took my own time to warm up. But there were people like Rakshan, Shivaangi, Pugazh and Sharath, who made me feel inclusive. I have to credit Shivaangi for helping me loosen up. They showed a positive vibe and the show\u2019s format itself is light-hearted. Now, I come up with my own set of counters (punchlines), thanks to them.\n\nAshwin Kumar is acting alongside Pugazh in an upcoming Tamil film | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement\n\nLet us take you back in time, when you left your hometown to get into films. Being an outsider, was there a sense of insecurity?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t smooth sailing for sure and my insecurity doubled when I came to Chennai. If not for my friend, who was motivating me and was also taking care of my expenses, I would have given up long time back.\n\nSometimes it\u2019sfrustrating when people randomly call you for auditions with a callous attitude saying, \u201cBe here tomorrow at 10.30 am.\u201d If you don\u2019t make it, it\u2019s a missed opportunity and sometimes, they won\u2019t even tell you whether you got the part or not! For instance, I waited nearly a year for this film and refrained from signing new projects. But only later did I come to know through a friend that shooting was already underway with a different actor.\n\nIt is a crushing feeling for someone starting out young\u2026\n\nYes. This is something beyond depression. Not getting an opportunity is one thing, but living in denial is another. You don\u2019t know whom you should take out all the anger...on the producer? Director? Or assistants? Ultimately, you end up taking it on yourself.\n\nMaybe Cook with Comali happened at the right time.\n\nTrue. Which is why when I got this offer, I felt it was all about food and maybe it\u2019s best if I don\u2019t take part. They [showrunners] told me that I can manage with the basics, but I made sure that I didn\u2019t miss out on this opportunity to prove my salt, and put my heart into it. I was doing a web series, which I cancelled to concentrate on the show. I thought I shouldn\u2019t look like a dummy on TV and improvised a lot, and it paid off. But to be honest, I am not a great cook\u2026\n\nAshwin, let me remind you that you are the show\u2019s second runner-up.\n\n[Laughs] That is because of the efforts I put in. I say this because I know I am not an expert. Both my mom and sister are great cooks; some of the best food I have had were made by them. When I moved to Chennai, I was yearning for good food and one of my friends used to cook. That is when I realised men can cook too.\n\nYou seemed to be challenging yourself on the show. I remember one episode when Venkatesh Bhat was floored when you made Onde Onde [Malaysian snack]...\n\nYes, I wanted to experiment. Getting pandan leaves was a bit difficult here, but I asked the team to get them for me. All my life, I was waiting for that one chance to prove myself and I gave my 100%. My concept was: \u2018If I can do it, you too can.\u2019\n\nI will be subjected to hate comments if I don\u2019t ask about Shivaangi, your pair on the show.\n\nYou cannot please someone to be your well wisher. Not just Shivaangi who made me feel at ease, but also the other people I met there. They somehow wanted to uplift me and I have tried to reciprocate that love.\n\nHave you got the chance to think about the show\u2019s success?\n\nWhat you saw was just three hours of content filtered from 300 hours of footage. We have to be grateful to the editors for bringing out the best in us. None of us were camera conscious and nothing was planned. Some of the things were a surprise for us too, when we watched the show.\n\nApart from this, what truly worked in the show\u2019s favour were the tasks given to us. That played a big role. Cooking is not as easy as people think, especially not with those hindrances. If you miss adding one ingredient, it changes the texture of the food.\n\nYou featured in \u2018Kutty Pattas\u2019 which went viral and now, are acting with your fellow comali, Pugazh, in a Tamil film. Is your talent being recognised now?\n\nCook with Comali was a rebirth of sorts for me. I never wanted to be on television because I wanted to be an actor. I didn\u2019t have contacts nor did I come from an affluent family. I have faced a lot of insults, rejections and have been pushed to the bottom but I didn\u2019t give up. I was hoping for that one chance. Wherever I went, the producer said they wanted fame and the director wanted money. I had neither. I felt a sense of achievement when I was given an award recently for Most Popular Person.\n\nSome of your fans wanted me to ask if you would open a restaurant and also want you to comment on your female fanbase...\n\nStarting a restaurant has always been a dream. Although I won\u2019t be the cook [laughs]. My goal is to start a restaurant and a sports academy.\n\nAbout fans, I am here because of them. I am getting offers and opportunities because of them. And I owe everything to them. They see their success in mine.\n\nDo you think the industry has changed its perception of you?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I would make it big, but this is something I have always wanted to say. There have been times when words hit me like a bullet. I have been subjected to humiliation while appearing for auditions. Self-respect is something you don\u2019t want to lose at any cost. You don\u2019t have to acknowledge our talent but at least treat us like humans? I don\u2019t want to demotivate aspirants but tell them through this interview that: be prepared."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4m523u/article34423693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/A-still-from-My-Octopus-Teacher", "Article's Title": "\u2018My Octopus Teacher\u2019: Swati Thiyagarajan on the Netflix documentary\u2019s Oscars win", "Article's Text": "Filmmaker and environmental journalist Swati talks to us about the award-winning film, that features her husband Craig Foster forging a relationship with an octopus\n\nWhen My Octopus Teacher first debuted on Netflix, viewers were unsure what to make of it from the title.

Excerpts from an interview:\n\nHow was such an unique idea for the documentary first conceptualised?\n\nCraig started to dive in the Great African Seaforest \u2014 at the southern tip of South Africa \u2014 everyday about ten years ago, when he needed to recover from facing burnout at work.\n\nPrior to this, he had made three or four movies back-to-back; all big wildlife films with deadlines, deliverables, shoot schedules etc. By the time he was done, he had pushed himself too far and wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to be a filmmaker anymore.\n\nThe place where he was most happy was always the ocean. So in the process of doing that, he really immersed himself in the Seaforest ecosystem, and learnt how to track underwater, when he met his \u201coctopus teacher\u201d.\n\nCraig Foster in a still from the documentary | Photo Credit: Netflix/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nThen began the extraordinary year of being able to observe her life. There was no plan at the time to make a film. The ecosystem slowly revitalised and gave him back energy, and he started filming again really from an exploration study point of view. It was later in the process that we thought we had a story here; Pippa (the co-director) came on board, and it really started to crystallise.\n\nIt was Craig\u2019s authentic, experienced story we wanted to tell; we didn\u2019t design it around how a global audience might react. That there was this unbelievable response was staggering.\n\nWhy do you think the themes in \u2018My Octopus Teacher\u2019 have resonated so much with viewers?\n\nI think while it\u2019s a nature documentary in the broad sense, it has also come across as a love letter to nature as a whole, and the octopus being a symbol of that. It is a movie about deep connection, empathy, healing, belonging\u2026 and these are universal human emotions. It\u2019s been more pronounced because of this tragic disconnected year we have all had as humans, isolating and distancing ourselves, and losing loved ones.\n\nWere there any challenges faced during the deep underwater shoots?\n\nCraig has been a filmmaker along with his brother for about 30 years now. He has always done his own camera work \u2014 and prior to this \u2014 he filmed sharks in a film called Sharkman and crocodiles in Into The Dragon\u2019s Lair. So he is very adept at filming underwater.\n\nBeing a free-diver, he can hold his breath for longish periods of time, and also knows where to place a camera, the best angles for the light and picture, etc. We also had Roger, our director of photography, who is one of the world\u2019s best underwater camera persons, go with him on several of the dives.\n\nWhat was your role in the project as the associate producer and production manager?\n\nAs Craig is my partner, and I am involved in conservation and wildlife myself, he would share with me stories from his diving experiences everyday, and discuss the footage and photographs.\n\nSwati with co-director Pippa Ehrlich and Craig Foster\n\nOur executive producer Ellen Windemuth is an old friend of Craig\u2019s, and had earlier made a film called The Great Dance with him. She too advised on the story and then we came up with a rough outline for the doc. The entire editing and filming all happened out of a room in my house, and I was involved through all of the processes.\n\nYour film was the favourite in the category going into the Oscars ceremony; was the win expected?\n\nIt was still a tremendous surprise because our fellow nominees were superb films, and every doc had the right to win. So it was hard to just believe we would succeed. When they first announced the nominees, and we saw our clip up there, and then they announced the winner\u2026 we were so excited. It\u2019s still sinking in!\n\nWhat would you want audiences to take away after watching the film, now that it\u2019s getting global exposure?\n\nThat we are wild, that we humans are an intrinsic part of nature... because we are nature. That we belong. That wild places and wild animals are infinitely precious. That our fellow non-human animals on the planet are a gift, and are on this same voyage of life as us. That bio-diversity is tremendously important and we need to rediscover our deep bonds with nature, which is in our DNA. That empathy and connection is key. And of course, that this great African Seaforest ecosystem is wonderful and worth long-term protection.\n\nSwati with other members of the \u2018My Octopus Teacher\u2019 documentary team\n\nWhat is next for you and Craig, any more film projects in the pipeline?\n\nNothing for a while, as stories have to flow organically. We are diving and swimming in the Seaforest everyday. The Sea Change Project which Craig co-founded, of which I am a part, is committed to telling stories, based in science and authentic immersive experiences. We will continue to share the joy and healing nature brings us, with as many people as possible.\n\nYour win has created a lot of cheer in India as someone representing the country at the Oscars\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s lovely if it has created cheer. I reside in South Africa now, but most of my life was lived in India. Right now, I am so absolutely heartbroken at the completely awful situation in the country with COVID-19. The pandemic, in a large part, is because of our exploitation of the natural world. It\u2019s most certainly my experiences in India in nature that shaped me, my ideas and thoughts; that\u2019s the part of India I brought with me to this film.\n\nWhat is your take on the support given to documentaries in India, and could a win like this influence it positively going forward?\n\nWe have some of the absolute best filmmakers in India in the documentary field, who are superb storytellers in wildlife, social and political spaces. The work is outstanding, so it\u2019s disheartening to see not much support for documentary films in the country.\n\nThe thing is, we shouldn\u2019t underestimate our audiences either. I remember when I was a student in Delhi at Jamia, all of the film festivals with documentaries ran to packed halls. There is this wilful blindness in the thinking that only commercial projects work.\n\nDocumentaries are dismissed as social subjects, and that\u2019s incredibly short-sighted because they can be anything, from a protest filmed on a phone to a carefully-crafted wildlife film. There are too few grants, too few foundations, and it\u2019s really sad because the talent is amazing and the raw materials for stories in India is limitless.\n\nI don\u2019t know if a win like this could make a difference, but the fact that today audiences consume films differently\u2026 it\u2019s not just in theatres, but online, streaming platforms and other mediums. This is exciting because it gives everyone the opportunity to think out-of-the-box, reset things, and create funding for documentaries, because there is opportunity to screen them and reach audiences.\n\nMy Octopus Teacher is currently streaming on Netflix"}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/4i96mi/article34421199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ifrscreen2", "Article's Title": "Immortals Fenyx Rising is \u2018ancient Greek meets Fantasia\u2019, says composer Gareth Coker", "Article's Text": "From commissioning Greek lyres to writing \u2018chicken music\u2019, animation and games composer Gareth Coker chats about how Ubisoft\u2019s Immortals Fenyx Rising does not take itself too seriously\n\nGareth Coker has been gaming since he was three years old. The British composer, now 36, has his name attached to landmark video games such as Moon Studios\u2019 Ori and the Blind Forest, Ori and the Will of the Wisps (both of which he was nominated for a BAFTA Games Award for Best Music), as well as 2020\u2019s Immortals Fenyx Rising. He also won the Excellence In Score Award at 2021\u2019s SXSW Gaming Awards for Ori and the Will of the Wisps.\n\n(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nSpeaking over a video call from his Los Angeles home on the game\u2019s score and how it helps tell the story for the player, Coker starts with why his favourite parts to score were the boss fights.\n\n\u201cI guess they are like mini-climaxes,\u201d he laughs. \u201cIn the case of Immortals, when I would send something to Ubisoft, they would respond, \u2018we love it, but can you make it louder?\u2019 (laughs) The game does not have too many epic boss fights, there is a lot of exploration and puzzle-solving. The standard combat is also not like the boss fight combat, so when you hear the boss fight music, it really stands out.\u201d\n\nImmortals Fenyx Rising is one of Ubisoft\u2019s more quirky releases, following a winged demi-god Fenix who embarks on a journey to save her brother who has been turned to stone, and faces off with evil god Typhon.\n\nComposer Gareth Coker during Ori and the Will of the Wisps scoring sessions at Air Studios London | Photo Credit: Benjamin Ealovega\n\nCoker says Immortals Fenyx Rising is certainly one of the less serious games he has worked on since he came on board in April 2019, after Ori and the Will of the Wisps. He also believes in coming on board with a game quite early on to gain a rapport with the storyline.\u201cIt also gives you time to fail, which is helpful not just to me in finding what doesn\u2019t work but also to the team working on the game itself.\u201d\n\nFor the saga-like action-adventure game, Coker, a Royal Academy of Music alum, scored more than five hours worth of music, each piece within that identifiable by the region to which Fenix travels. \u201cFrom Ori and the Will of the Wisps that is generally very dark in tone, to Immortals was refreshing. If you take out the light-hearted banter such as that between Zeus and Prometheus, it is still a fun game which informs how I write the music. When I do hear the voices, it does add to that.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of voices, Coker experienced something with Immortals Fenyx Rising\u2019s dialogue music that was also new in his career. \u201cIn each area, there were different suites of music that each had positive, neutral and negative layers. Based on the contour of the conversation, the music changes on the fly. I remember wondering how this would work, but the benefit of being on board early is, I was able to tweak the parameters to suit these needs,\u201d he recalls.\n\nCoker was surprised when the developers said there would even be music during dialogue which he initially considered almost \u201ca dirty word,\u201d and this was prominent during old school games. This custom-cut method for Immortals Fenyx Rising works especially well during positive cut-scenes, including one of the fan favourites where players meet Ares, god of war, for the first time \u2014 and he has been turned into a chicken. He laughs, \u201cI thought \u2018oh, it is time to make chicken music, whatever that is!\u2019 It is almost like you are playing a Dreamworks game.\u201d\n\nFor Greek sounds\n\nThough it is rooted in Greek mythology, Coker points out the game does not take itself too seriously. \u201cIt is high contrast and high saturation. The animation is much more exaggerated, so the overall look of the game is not photo-realistic. If Immortals were so, the score would not work; it is too much and over the top.\u201d\n\nRead More | \u2018Immortals Fenyx Rising\u2019 game review: This one\u2019s for the whole family\n\nIt was integral that he get immersed into Greek sounds, he says. So he commissioned two lyres from a Greek luthier and had the fragile instruments shipped all the way to the United States.\n\n\u201cIt was necessary. We did not want a hardcore authentic Greek soundtrack. The most ubiquitous ancient Greek instruments are the lyres \u2014 many different kinds which I commissioned because they each play a limited number of notes but they really have a unique sound.\u201d Did Coker get to keep the lyres? In response, he spins in his seat and points towards the back of his studio space, \u201cThere it is!\u201d\n\nCoker got his hands on an aulos as well, an ancient reed woodwind instrument, for one of the musicians for the game. \u201cIt is horrendous and not hugely pleasant sounding,\u201d he grins. \u201cIt does have a mysterious and frenetic sound to it.\u201d\n\nCoker used the same musical scales as the ancient Greeks. \u201cI didn\u2019t use them exclusively but rather the flavours of those scales,\u201d he adds, pointing out he was still mindful of not going all-out authentic. \u201cOtherwise the player\u2019s brain is going to switch off as that music would not be accesible and this would not align with the tone of the story and look of the experience. I would describe it as \u2018ancient Greek meets Fantasia\u2019 and a soundtrack was born.\u201d\n\nCD Projekt Red\u2019s The Witcher 3 \u2013 a game which Coker did not work on but admires \u2013 is an example. \u201cThe score has a lot of heavy Slavic influences, and it\u2019s amazing. But it is blended with modern sensibilities to make it accessible,\u201d he points out.\n\nPlayer in mind?\n\nCoker says as a composer, he wants the player to \u201cspend as much time in the game as possible\u201d and music is certainly part of that strategy. \u201cOne way I would describe Immortals Fenyx Rising is that it is inviting. It has that feel of \u2018what\u2019s around the corner?\u2019. It does well with visual landmarks with this custom-built landscape and world that creates space for lots of exploration. I wish there was a book on how to do that \u2013 it would sell really well (laughs).\u201d\n\nOther projects Another highly-awaited video game Coker is working on is Halo Infinite (Xbox Game Studios) due to release this year. He is also working on the anticipated Ark: The Animated Series that stars Vin Diesel, Gerard Butler, Michelle Yeoh, Malcolm McDowell, Elliot Page, Ragga Ragnars, David Tennant, Karl Urban, and Russell Crowe. The television series is due to come out in 2022. There is also Studio Wildcard\u2019s coinciding game, Ark II, to which Coker lends his talents.\n\nDo all video games composers come from a point of empathy for the player? Coker considers there to be two schools of game composers out there \u2014 one that is very hands-on with a game, and the other that is not. \u201cBoth work,\u201d he insists. \u201cThe composers who aren\u2019t, and this is key, usually work with amazing music supervisors and audio teams, taking that composer\u2019s work and maybe rearranging it and putting it into the game. But the music will still be beautiful.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Coker has learned both of these methods but says he \u201clikes to be hands-on with the game, which is more holistic. This is why I always like to come on board with a video game early on, as I get to talk more with the developers and get the synergy going. But (laughs) it is a ton of work.\u201d"}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/pu18ib/article34430654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sai-shravanam6", "Article's Title": "Sound engineer Sai Shravanam: \u2018Views do not define music, intent does\u2019", "Article's Text": "Loved \u2018Enjoy Enjaami\u2019 and the tracks from \u2018Karnan\u2019? It is the result of several hours put in by sound engineer Sai Shravanam whose latest project is a tribute to India\u2019s rivers\n\nSai Shravanam is playing an aalaap from his recent musical project \u2018Rivers of India\u2019 at his state-of-the-art recording studio Resound India in Adyar, a place he calls \u201cmy temple\u201d.\n\nHe toggles between computer monitors and a giant recording console to play two tracks \u2014 one original and the other he has worked on \u2014 and points out the musical difference. \u201cI wanted this portion of the track to be ethereal and the voice to be God-like. Sound engineering is incredibly important to bring the best out of a musician,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd he should know; Sai is the man behind the rich sound of several leading musicians in films and classical music universe. Recently, he received the Kalaimamani award from the Tamil Nadu Government, becoming the first sound recordist to do so. His recent works include the viral hit \u2018Enjoy Enjaami\u2019 and tracks from Dhanush\u2019s Karnan, but Sai is pumped at the response for \u2018Rivers of India\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe song is a tribute to precious water resources in the country and stresses on the need to protect them,\u201d he says.\n\nConceived by Kanniks Kannikeswaran, \u2018Rivers of India\u2019 not only features a never-before-seen collaboration between Bombay Jayashri, Kaushiki Chakraborty, Rishith Desikan and Amrit Ramnath, but also has a chorus section by the global IIT alumni. \u201cHe [Kanniks] has worked hard for spreading Indian choral music in the US; he called me about this project for IIT-Madras,\u201d recalls Sai.\n\nThe duo realised that there was not a single song that carries the names of all the major rivers in India, and decided to weave them into a song. \u201cProjects like these give me immense happiness as it helps me explore my thirst as a musician and producer. Rivers are something that several generations witness; so we roped in two mother-son duos (Bombay Jayashri and Amrit, and Kaushiki Chakraborty and Rishith Desikan),\u201d he adds.\n\nBombay Jayashri and Amrit Ramnath\n\nA different beat\n\nSai believes sound is precious and that he has earned the sobriquet \u2018the man with the golden ear\u2019 because he does not distinguish between genres. \u201cThe day I see music as different things, such as classical, films and others, I will be finished. Sound and music are my greatest inspiration irrespective of who the artiste is.\u201d\n\nHis own musicality too plays a big role when he is mixing and mastering songs. \u201cI am not a technician who changes plug-ins. I end up involving myself a lot with the work,\u201d says Sai. His other role is that of a tabla player; he has been playing regularly for AR Rahman and has had many memorable experiences. \u2018Tum Ko Paa Hi Liya\u2019 in Rockstar was one. \u201cI was called and I played just once, and was then asked to leave. There were no retakes. I thought that Rahman sir had not liked what I played, but when I heard the song, the entire portion I played was retained. When I asked him about it, he said, \u2018What comes first comes from God. What comes next comes from you\u2019. That profound statement changed the way I look at life,\u201d he adds.\n\nKaushiki Chakraborty and Rishith Desikan\n\nScript and sound\n\nSai has a unique way of working with songs; he sequences them in order in his recording console, much like how a storyboard artist would do with a script. \u201cSequencing is important because I believe that storytelling is an integral part of music,\u201d says Sai, whose upcoming projects including songs with composer C Sathya and singer-composer Sean Roldan.\n\nHe is very much a behind-the-scenes technician who contributes to the final musical output. \u201cSound engineering is not merely tweaking a few knobs. It is a lifetime dedication towards music because it can make or break a song,\u201d he says.\n\nSai usually works more than 15 hours a day, cocooned in his air-conditioned studio and working on various genres of music that are dished out by composers. \u201cIt might sound like a nice job but it comes with challenges; as a sound engineer, we have to keep listening to various versions of a single line multiple times and in various frequencies to see which works and which doesn\u2019t. Only if there is passion and a love for music can one do that. In today\u2019s movies, there is pressure for success. There is always an expectation on it to become hits. But views do not define music, intent defines it,\u201d he adds."}, {"Article Image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-82289149,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-374240/82289149.jpg", "Article's Title": "Rakul Preet Singh wishes Samantha Akkineni on her birthday; says 'Shine on and keep inspiring always'", "Article's Text": "Veteran actor Kabir Bedi\u2019s granddaughter Alaya F, who is an avid social media user, made her Bollywood debut in 2020 with \u2018Jawaani Jaaneman\u2019 alongside Saif Ali Khan and Tabu.

While fans continue to refer to it as a \u2018personal loss\u2019, several of them have paid tributes to the late actor in their own unique ways. Likewise, the city of dreams - Mumbai witnessed one such mesmerising ode in black, white, and yellow hues, standing tall and bright on a wall of a quaint street in the Ranwar village of Bandra, Mumbai. While it has now become one of the attractions in the city, ETimes dialed the artist duo, Ranjit Dahiya and Vikas Bansal from Bollywood Art Project- the mastermind who immortalised Irrfan in everyone\u2019s heart.Mumbai is the city of Bollywood and I thought let\u2019s make it apt for its name as people come here out of curiosity for the industry. This is when we started creating Bollywood-inspired murals.While creating art or a mural, we always think about its social impact. For this case, Irrfan Khan\u2019s mural was apt for Ranwar village of Bandra because the shooting of his film \u2018 Lunchbox \u2019 was done there. The residents of the area are already connected with Irrfan through his film, hence we decided that it was the right place for him. According to me, \u2018Lunchbox\u2019 was his best film.Being his fan, I was really shocked for hours when I heard about his demise and then later realised that I need to do something about it and decided to make his mural. This tribute means a lot to me.Like I just mentioned, I was really sad after knowing that Irrfan is no more. Besides being my favorite actor, he was also a great person. While this happened during the lockdown, Vikas was in Mumbai, so we both decided to pay a tribute with whatever paint I had left at my house.It was a little tough, I won\u2019t lie. There was the initial lockdown going on due to the pandemic. So, it was a challenge for us and we used whatever material we had left with us. But I think our love for Irrfan and art kept us going, after all, you only need a piece of charcoal to create art, if not anything else.The building owner Mr. David is a cool person and most importantly, he is also one of Irrfan\u2019s biggest fans. So, right when we called him to seek his permission for painting his walls he was very happy and supportive.Besides, we were only two people out on the streets with all safety precautions. If you ask about getting permission, it isn\u2019t easy usually but we knew the owner so it was fine.I have quite a few celebs on my bucket list. I want to paint Helen ji next.I am from Delhi but Mumbai meri jaan hai!

From its storyline to the direction and soothing songs, \u2018Gangster\u2019 was a perfect mix. And since then, there has been no looking back for the actress. The film also starred Emraan Hashmi and Shiney Ahuja in key roles. As the film clocks 15 years of release today, ETimes got in touch with Kangana, who spoke about her inspirational journey. She spilled the beans on how \u2018Gangster\u2019 happened, her perfect debut with Anurag Basu 's film, how Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi called her after watching the film and more! Excerpts:Oh yes, it\u2019s 15 years now! (smiles) To be honest, it feels great. When \u2018Gangster\u2019 happened, I was in desperate need of work and it was seeming like forever. I had left home and stayed in Delhi trying to figure out what I wanted to do and then I was struggling in Mumbai doing ads. I wasn't getting much success in modelling. Even though it was quite quick, within a few months of being in Mumbai I got this break but yet everyday rejections and every day failing in auditions, it just felt so demotivating. But surprisingly when I got this ad, I got another one or two films and one of them was a South film which became quite a big hit. So suddenly it just happened that I was so wanted as a struggling newcomer. People used to say that actresses have a shelf life of 4-5 years and I used to wonder why people say something like this? Are we some product off the shelf? It used to feel so odd, even as a teenager when people used to say something like this to me, especially some Lokhandwala managers I used to have at that time. Everybody used to talk about shelf life and look, it's been 15 years. It feels good and I am on top of my game and I feel that I have a long way to go. So to hell with all those who said that actresses have a shelf life of 3-4 years.It was a perfect debut for me for sure. To be working with Anurag Basu and that school of art\u2026I was trained in theatre, I was not trained in movies and to be working under Anurag was the biggest USP of \u2018Gangster\u2019 for me. He is a terrific director and a very instinctive, creative person. At the same time, he has a theatre background so he understood me and where I came from. In addition, he is a very good actor himself. So he told me things about films, how they differ from theatre and how I need to completely internalize my acting as opposed to a very theatrical way of acting. So I would say that it was a perfect break for me but yet, coming from that route it was a struggle also from parallel cinema. During that time, it was a one-of-a-kind film that did well. There was no market for such films and such actors. I was very unconventional for a mainstream actress. Anurag enhanced that about me. I was so skinny and had curly hair and he enhanced all that and that made me even more unfit. So for many years, I was doing those homeless kinds of edgy roles which were very difficult. I was 16 when I started and finally with \u2018Tanu Weds Manu\u2019, I was 23 or 24 and had just broken free of those edgy, neurotic characters (laughs). So in a way, it was very good for me to be launched in that way.I was in Mumbai and was sent for some auditions. There were these models who were going to Vishesh films for \u2018Gangster\u2019 auditions and I tagged along because I had that look. Even my manager encouraged me. My friend Mohit took my audition. He didn't even audition me actually. I was sitting there and they refused to audition me and basically rejected me before they could audition me. So I left and my pictures reached Anurag and I got a frantic call in a few days that 'you have to come and meet the director'. I replied saying that \u2018I have already auditioned and met the director\u2019. They said, \u2018No, the director has never met you.\u2019 It was actually the AD's who were doing auditions. So I went to meet them and Anurag started auditioning me for various scenarios like being drunk, crying, being homeless and gave me some lines and then he got a camera and said that I did well. But I didn\u2019t know if I had the job or not. Later I found that there was some conflict internally to cast me as a model in the film as I was a minor myself and it was impossible for me to have a child at that age. But Anurag liked me in a way that I looked for the role and for a long time I was hanging in there.So the funniest thing happened. Before the shooting, we were supposed to go to Seoul, South Korea for the shoot and I was such a kid. The production boy came to the rented apartment I was staying at. He came and told me, \u2018we want your passport and I replied 'What is that? '. I didn't know what a passport was. He looked at me horrified and went back to Anurag who later called and said \u2018 Ye kya ladki hai tu, pagal hai kya tu? Kaha se aayi hai?\u201d (laughs). He also said that I might lose the role. That time I was not talking to my father, but I called him to ask about the passport. Mukesh (Bhatt) sir had called me and had the same reaction. He told me, \u2018 Beta, tumhare pass passport nahi hai, kaha se aayi ho tum?\u2019 (laughs). They started to audition other girls for the role. I pleaded to my father to get the procedure done. At that time it used to take 3-4 months for it. In the end, my father pulled some strings and got the passport. Anurag was the happiest person because they were looking for my replacement. Literally, it was like one of those climax moments in movies that you get it done at the last minute. It is another story where they forgot to write my surname and at every airport, everyone asked me, \u2018hey, you don\u2019t have a surname?\u2019 That\u2019s another story for another day.Of course, I remember. It was from Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi Ji, who called me after watching the film. They were absolutely stunned and they kept repeating 'who are you? ', ' where are you from? ', \u2018you did so well', 'who taught you acting?', 'Are you from here or some other universe? '. That is how they reacted and it felt nice. They were very kind and welcoming of me and my art. It was only later that I realized that when things change, people also change.There is a lot of learning that happened during \u2018Gangster\u2019. Of course, filming an entire film, it was shocking that how many shots of one single line can happen, how consistent your performance should be, it shouldn\u2019t drop... things like continuity or building a graph. With every film, you keep learning, but the first film that you do, there are so many technicalities that pour in. So there are a lot of things that have always remained with me. Above everything, I learned cinema acting and that was a big change in my life."}, {"Article Image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-82275202,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-725125/82275202.jpg", "Article's Title": "#OneYearOfMissingIrrfan: Sutapa: There are times I feel Irrfan is around, he is just not physically present", "Article's Text": "Veteran actor Kabir Bedi\u2019s granddaughter Alaya F, who is an avid social media user, made her Bollywood debut in 2020 with \u2018Jawaani Jaaneman\u2019 alongside Saif Ali Khan and Tabu.

He was an action hero, the angry young man. So roles were written for him. Although we may have been smaller stars, we were not lesser actors. Yet, the rest of us had to constantly measure up to him. We had to work hard, really exert ourselves to match up. In my time, the musical/romantic hero had no place. Amitabh was an action hero in an era of action films. As such, writers gave him the lion\u2019s share and he had the authorbacked roles in almost all his films. This gave him an advantage over the rest of us who had to make our presence felt with whatever we got. But this is something that Amitabh has never ever admitted to, in any interview or book.

Sharing that even when there were a lot of difficult steps, Salman did it all effortlessly.\n\nReferring to one of the sequences where Salman Khan is seen holding Disha Patani in his arms, Prabhudheva shares, \u201cHe came on set and was like \u2018Prabhu, I will pick Disha as in doing weight lifting in this step.\u2019\u201d\n\nDisha also went on to reveal how Salman improvises on set, adding that it was intimidating to shoot with Prabhudheva. \u201cIt\u2019s a complete south style number with a lot of hip hop dance moves. It was quite a challenge, but Salman sir never said no to anything,\u201d she reveals.\n\nHeaping praises on the superstar, the actor adds, \u201cIt\u2019s always so much fun working with him. When he performs, he doesn\u2019t have a care. He truly dances like no one\u2019s watching. It is part of his swag, and he makes it look so effortless. I think no one can dance like him.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the video, Salman Khan also credits composer Devi Siri Prasad for the \u2018outstanding track\u2019. Prabhudheva, on his part, says that the song is going to be a \u2018treat to the eyes\u2019.\n\nWhile sharing \u201cSeeti Maar\u201d on social media platforms, Salman Khan had even thanked Allu Arjun. He wrote, \u201cThank u Allu arjun for seeti maar absolutely loved the way u have performed in the song, the way u dance, your style, u r simply fantastic.. tk care n b safe. Rgds to ur family .. love u brother.\u201d Allu also replied to the tweet, \u201cThank you soo much Salman garu . It\u2019s a pleasure to receive a compliment from you .

Four years ago today, there was no fear of crowd and viruses, the only thing on the minds of people who headed for early morning shows (6 am or even earlier) of the SS Rajamouli epic was to find their seats on time before the show began. The moment the doors opened, people rushed inside, not afraid to step on toes or others shoving you.\n\nIn these Covid times, it is hard to imagine a world without social distancing but that was the scene in over 6000 theatres across India on April 28, 2017. Everybody in the country wanted to see Baahubali 2 and everyone did, sooner or later. That\u2019s why the film went onto become the highest earner in the history of Indian cinema. We are a deeply diverse country. All of us have different taste in movies, favourite stars and filmmakers. Take south India, for example. The movie fans in Tamil Nadu may not feel as excited about the release of, say, an Allu Arjun film, as they would about an Ajith starrer. And movie fans in the Telugu states may not feel the same level of eagerness for a Vijay movie, that they would normally feel for a Mahesh Babu starrer. The Hindi speaking audiences, meanwhile, have been immune to the charms of films coming from south other than a few exceptions.\n\nHowever, Baahubali did away with those barriers. The images of people forming long queues outside the theatres to buy tickets before the release of the movie are still fresh in the memory. And it was not limited to south Indian states, it was a pan-India phenomenon. And mind you, it was a time when people had the option to buy tickets in advance through online platforms. While some queues were running up to a few kilometres, the online ticketing platforms were also overwhelmed.\n\nA day before the release of director SS Rajamouli\u2019s magnum opus, Bookmyshow sold 12 tickets every second for the film. Within a day, the ticketing platform sold more than one million tickets. It is one of the new business records that the film created close to its release. And naturally, the ticket prices skyrocketed. In the states, where movie ticket prices were not regulated by the government, tickets sold in the excess of Rs 600. And the prices at the luxury screens touched a new high.\n\nAnother one @PrasadsMultiplx, 7 am. From my experience of last time, order goes to toss as gates open! #baahubali2 #BaahubaliTheConclusion pic.twitter.com/b1oY4PcFUX \u2014 Pranita Jonnalagedda (@PranitaRavi) April 26, 2017\n\nAt a time, when Bollywood was obsessed with the 100-crore club and big stars waited for days for their films to reach the coveted mark, Baahubali smashed that record within a few hours of its release. The movie collected worldwide more than Rs 100 crore on its opening day. And it became the fastest and the first Indian film to earn Rs 1000 crore from ticket sales within 10 days of its theatrical launch. So on average, the film netted Rs 100 crore every day for 10 days, dwarfing all the previous collection records in the history of Indian cinema.\n\nThe Hindi dubbed version of the movie raked in more than Rs 500 crore a little over 30 days after its release. To put it in context, the highest-grossing film in the history of Bollywood is a Telugu film, starring a regional movie star in lead, Prabhas. The final collection of Baahubali 2 is said to be touching Rs 1800 crore.\n\nHowever, emerging as India\u2019s biggest earner globally was not the only achievement of Baahubali 2. Yes, it showed the members of the Indian film fraternity the true size of the domestic market. It opened up new earning opportunities for regional movies in a big way. Now, \u201cthe pan-India movie\u201d is the keyword that drives the mainstream business in regional cinema. It changed the hierarchy of power in Indian cinema. Now, more than ever, Bollywood filmmakers keep close tabs on what south Indian filmmakers are working on.\n\nAnd more importantly, Baahubali 2 mainly united India, cutting across the barriers of language and culture. It was a power that so far remained within the confines of the cricket.\n\nAnd that was four years ago. Today, we are on the brink of a new world, where looking at a crowd of 10 at a supermarket strikes terror in our hearts. When we come out of this pandemic, we don\u2019t know what \u201cnormal\u201d would look like. But, we can say with some certainty, India is unlikely to share the mutual excitement over going to the theatre to watch another movie in the foreseeable future. Baahubali 2 could be perhaps the last movie to have received such overwhelming love from people in India. It could mark an important era that has come to an end. Baahubali 2 success could be the last of its kind in the history of India\u2019s cinema-going."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/allu-arjun-1200by667.jpg", "Article's Title": "Allu Arjun tests positive for Covid-19", "Article's Text": "Telugu superstar Allu Arjun on Wednesday revealed that he has tested positive for Covid-19.

Today, she is a multifaceted personality with a great star value. As she gets ready to debut in Hindi cinema with the second season of The Family Man, it is time to take a dive into her existing body of work. So, on her birthday today, here we bring you her five best performances on the big screen.\n\nOh! Baby (2019)\n\nThis BV Nandini Reddy directorial is a remake of the South Korean hit movie Miss Granny. The film tells the story of an aged woman named Baby, whose soul magically gets trapped in a young woman\u2019s body (Samantha). In the movie, Samantha\u2019s antics as a young woman with orthodox thoughts are super fun to watch from the word go. Her performance received unanimous praise from the critics and the audience alike.\n\nMajili (2019)\n\nMajili is the fourth outing of Samantha and Naga Chaitanya after Manam, Autonagar Surya, and Ye Maaya Chesave. In the film, Samantha portrayed a character named Sravani, a working woman who has immense love for her husband Poorna (Naga Chaitanya). Samantha\u2019s performance as a woman who tries to change her husband was appreciated.\n\nRangasthalam (2018)\n\nSam\u2019s character from this movie remains a unique one. Her performance as Ramalakshmi, a village belle, is a treat to watch indeed. It shows her commitment to choose diverse roles.\n\nA Aa (2016)\n\nA Aa \u2013 Anasuya Ramalingam Aanand Vihari is Samantha\u2019s third collaboration with director Trivikram. In the film, she got an author-backed role that differs from the routine heroine tracks in contemporary Telugu dramas. If not for Samantha, the film would have been a routine fare instead of the entertaining and impactful drama.\n\n\n\nYe Maaya Chesave (2010)\n\nFor any heroine, especially in Telugu cinema, it is rare to get a role that gives a solid scope to perform during their debut. Samantha\u2019s first movie, a Gautham Vasudev Menon directorial Ye Maaya Chesave gave her that rare opportunity.

His heavyweight force in Creed. His capacity to inspire change as Bryan Stevenson in Just Mercy. His raw fury in Black Panther.\n\nBut Jordan\u2019s potency reaches new, muscular heights in Without Remorse a Tom Clancy adaptation that recasts Jordan as a globe-trotting action star. The film (which debuts Friday on Amazon Prime Video) is an updated origin story of Navy SEAL John Clark, Clancy\u2019s best-known character outside of Jack Ryan. Jordan is hoping it spawns a franchise.\n\nThe project has been around Hollywood for decades; Keanu Reeves and Tom Hardy are among those who have previously flirted with it. But Jordan saw the possibility to not only do a big-budget action thriller and perform a lot of his own stunts, but to retailor the film to today. He\u2019s a producer on the film via his company, Outlier Society Productions, a leading force in making Hollywood more inclusive.\n\nJordan spent much of the past year quarantined with his family and friends, a time he says has that has been reflective.\n\n\u201cThe last few years I\u2019ve been blessed to have a kind of non-stop career,\u201d says Jordan, speaking by phone from Los Angeles. \u201cI kind of had a moment to look at myself and family, spend time with my nephew \u2014 things that I probably wouldn\u2019t have had as much time to do if I was running from one production to another.\u201d\n\nBut after the pandemic put a slight pause on one of the movies\u2019 biggest stars, Jordan is eager to embark on a new chapter. He recently filmed Denzel Washington\u2019s A Journal for Jordan. He\u2019s prepping his directorial debut with Creed III.\n\nThe 34-year-old spoke with The Associated Press the day after the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial. Remarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nLast summer at protests following the death of George Floyd, you challenged Hollywood to commit to Black hiring. Have you seen any progress?\n\nFrom the projects that I\u2019ve been involved with, I\u2019ve seen a response to that. I\u2019m not in the weeds with every production across Hollywood but I think there was a significant or meaningful response from the industry on certain levels to be held accountable. But there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. We\u2019re not content with things we have or things that we see at the moment.\n\nHas anything about the past year changed your priorities?\n\nI went through a rollercoaster of emotions. The pandemic, the protests, this steady increase of police brutality and murders \u2014 it\u2019s been tough, man. You have a moment where things went our way yesterday and then hours later, you have another one. This past year has seen so much of that. Recharging my batteries was something that I didn\u2019t know I needed as much as I did. After taking that break, I feel more energized and prepared for the work to come \u2014 and that\u2019s in all areas. When it comes to being present for my community, my culture, for my business; in front of the camera, behind the camera; in the streets, in my home. It\u2019s given me an opportunity to be a better version of myself moving forward. I\u2019m motivated. I\u2019m recharged. I\u2019m ready for all tasks at hand.\n\nIn Fruitvale Station, playing Oscar Grant, you acted out a version of a scene that keeps replaying.\n\nWhen you\u2019re Black and brown, it\u2019s something that can become a reality any day. Yeah, I had an opportunity to shine a light on a story, on a young man who had his life taken away from him by the hands of law enforcement. When we shot that movie, I guess it wasn\u2019t being seen as much as it is right now. The volume of what\u2019s been reported has increased, it\u2019s more a part of the popular conversation. But it\u2019s a lot. I think solidarity amongst our community and culture is at the highest point that I\u2019ve experienced. It\u2019s driving us closer together. And people unified is a powerful thing.\n\nDo you ever find it difficult to balance any responsibility you feel and your own interests? Do you sometimes just want to make a movie without worrying about larger issues?\n\nI just made one! Without Remorse and Journal for Jordan. I like all types of movies. From action thrillers to movies with a purpose. I got Creed coming up. I\u2019ve been blessed to have a healthy balance. It allows me to have that comfortable balance between entertainment and activism. That\u2019s life, right? Trying to find a balance. You have moments in your life where you\u2019ve got to do things for yourself, you\u2019ve got to do things that feed your soul. And you\u2019ve got to do things that feed your community, so you know the person looking at you in the morning in the mirror. If you can find a way to balance all those things and be successful and leave an impact \u2014 and leave the world a better place. I think making people think is the power of cinema.\n\n\n\nWithout Remorse had been in development hell for years. What drew you to it?\n\nI\u2019m a gamer. I love playing videogames. I grew up playing (Tom Clancy adaptations) Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon before I even got introduced to the films. Man, I got an opportunity to play a character I used to envision myself playing, that I spent hours upon hours (laughs) in my room playing. Being able to step into the Tom Clancy universe and do an action movie where I do my own stunts. I was a kid in the candy store.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about injecting yourself into a role like a Trojan horse. Was there anything especially that you wanted to bring to Without Remorse?\n\nIt was a great collaboration between the studio, the producers, the director to create an origin story. It was cool to see a character that just is. There\u2019s no extra \u201cThis character is Black because of this and that.\u201d It\u2019s a movie about a guy, know what I mean?\n\n\n\nLike another upcoming film of yours, a new Thomas Crown Affair, your character wasn\u2019t originally written as Black and had previously been played by white actors (Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber). Do you give any significance to that?\n\nThere\u2019s a business behind this, as well. A lot of people don\u2019t understand the nuances of how movies get made \u2014 what (intellectual property) is at what studio, what IP is available, the value of a reboot versus doing something without that title. There\u2019s a lot of different factors to consider when you remake a movie or you do a movie. People would be surprised that race is very low on the totem pole when it comes to making some of those decisions. A lot of people speculate on these movie choices but what I pay attention to is: I really like the movie. The character\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s entertaining and I\u2019m going to have fun making it. And representation is important. Somebody like myself playing a character like that in a world like that is also very progressive and entertaining. It\u2019s a nuanced decision to develop movies like that. Sometimes it\u2019s not that simple. Other times, it\u2019s not that complicated, either."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/First-of-many-matasha-rastogi-monsoon-wedding-1200.jpg", "Article's Title": "First of Many: Natasha Rastogi revisits Monsoon Wedding", "Article's Text": "Natasha Rastogi might have taken up acting late in her life, but she\u2019s managed to be a part of some noteworthy projects. She says her journey from the stage to films taught her a lot, and a boom in the digital space has turned out to be a blessing for artistes like her.\n\nNatasha recently played mother to Sanya Mahotra in Netflix release Pagglait. Natasha\u2019s body of work also boasts of movies like Khosla Ka Ghosla, Do Dooni Chaar, My Name Is Khan, Ishaqzaade, Amit Sahni Ki List, Talvar, Naam Shabana, Behen Hogi Teri and others. She has been a part of Raat Akeli Hai and Bandish Bandits too.\n\nThough Natasha started with a small role in Monsoon Wedding (2001), she says it was the experience that she holds close to her heart. Here\u2019s what she shared about the first time she faced camera professionally.\n\nWhat was your first acting project? How did the project come to you?\n\nI was a dramatics teacher in Modern School and was doing theatre as well. My close friend Shubha Mudgal told me that Mira Nair is auditioning for her film. I auditioned for a scene where a sangeet ceremony is happening and I have a telephonic conversation. Another scene was where I get down from a car with Neha Dubey who played my daughter, and I tell Naseeruddin Shah, \u201cWe\u2019ve got you real scotch. Thank you for taking care of my little Alia.\u201d\n\nI got a call if I had a video recording or pictures of my work. I had none because I hadn\u2019t started acting professionally then. But still I landed the role in Monsoon Wedding. It was shot in 2000, got released in 2001. I was 39 then. I started very late in life.\n\nNatasah Rastogi with co-actor Rahul Vohra in a still from Monsoon Wedding (2001). Natasah Rastogi with co-actor Rahul Vohra in a still from Monsoon Wedding (2001).\n\nWhat do you remember of your first day on set?\n\nSince the film revolved around a wedding, almost all the actors were on set. My first day of shoot was the same that I auditioned for. Its location was in Delhi, at Chattarpur farms or Bijwasan I guess. I shot for 25 days and the film was wrapped up in 30-35 days. That was the time when films took 8 months to complete. So Mira Nair shooting an entire film in such a short time, was another big news back then.\n\nThe first scene I shot for was where Rajat Kapoor takes my daughter for an ice-cream. Shefali Shah comes and asks him where he was taking her. She tells him to get off the car because he had abused Shefali when she was a kid. Rajat Kapoor plays the uncle in it. After Shefali, I enter the scene and hold my daughter close. Mira thought there isn\u2019t a need for two people doing the scene, so my part got slashed.\n\nWhen I went for dubbing, Mira apologised and told me that she had to edit out my one major scene. That\u2019s the first time I got to know that your scene can get chopped off too. Now I feel like I was more like a flower vase in the film.\n\nWere you nervous? How many retakes did you take?\n\nI believe an actor should memorise the lines first, only then you can play with the scene. When you do theatre, you need to perform for even the person sitting in the last row. On camera, you need to hold back. There was no nervousness as such. But it was definitely a learning experience, as compared to theatre. I had small scenes and the film did very well. And then casting people in the circuit started looking at me.\n\nHow was the rapport with your co-stars when you got to meet or work with them again later?\n\nIt was so much fun. I felt the film was a live wedding. We used to shoot the entire night. There was Soni Razdan, Lillete Dubey, we used to sit and chit chat. It was like a family. I used to wonder if they\u2019ll shoot the film or we\u2019ll just keep having fun. So you can say, the entire film was made just like that.\n\nAlso Read | First of Many: Gajraj Rao | Vivek Oberoi | Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub | Rajpal Yadav | Rajeev Khandelwal | Govind Namdev | Neena Gupta | Pankaj Tripathi | Satish Kaushik | Mohit Raina | Shahid Kapoor | Anang Desai | Jimmy Sheirgill | Tabu | Harsh Chhaya | Gaurav Gera | Saurabh Shukla | Deepak Dobriyal | Seema Pahwa | Annup Sonii | Sayantani Ghosh | Annu Kapoor | Ajay Devgn | Vishal Malhotra | Rahul Khanna | Ashutosh Rana | Jaaved Jaaferi | Ashwath Bhatt | Varun Badola | Renuka Shahane | Taapsee Pannu | Manoj Bajpayee | Milind Soman | Rajkummar Rao | Akhilendra Mishra | Rohit Roy | Suchitra Pillai | Gulshan Grover | Abhay Deol | Ashwini Kalsekar | Adil Hussain | Shweta Tiwari | Purab Kohli | Mita Vasisht | Vipin Sharma | Divya Dutta | Jaideep Ahlawat | Archana Puran Singh | Daya Shankar Pandey | Hina Khan | Rajesh Tailang | Urvashi Dholakia | Manish Chaudhari | Sheeba Chadha | Karanvir Bohra | Bhairavi Raichura | Pratik Gandhi | Konkona Sen Sharma | Gurmeet Choudhary | Lakshmi Manchu | Zakir Hussain | Nimrat Kaur | Hiten Tejwani | Ayesha Raza Mishra | Ali Fazal | Riya Sen | Rakesh Bedi | Samir Kochhar | Shekhar Suman | Piyush Mishra | Neelu Vaghela | Sumeet Vyas | Ayub Khan | Cyrus Sahukar | Vindu Dara Singh | Karan Singh Grover | Amrita Puri | Arjun Mathur\n\nIf given a chance to go back to your debut role, what would you like to change or do better?\n\nNot really, it was all script based. And since it was a small role, today I\u2019ll want it to be longer, with some good scenes. But, that was my first journey towards Bollywood and facing the camera. It was a pleasure working with Mira Nair.\n\nOne film or role that inspired you to become an actor?\n\nI loved Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam. I wish somebody could cast me for Meena Kumari\u2019s part. I think she was brilliant. Nobody can do what she did. I also loved The Great Indian Kitchen which I saw recently."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/babbar1200.jpg", "Article's Title": "Prateik Babbar inks mother Smita Patil\u2019s name on chest, writes \u2018Smita forever.\u2019 See post", "Article's Text": "Actor Prateik Babbar recently took to Instagram to reveal that he has gotten his mother\u2019s name, Smita, tattooed on his chest.

And while the celluloid and his fans will always miss him, the artiste continues to inspire a great deal of love and respect even today with his performances and journey. In a video of over four years ago, Irrfan Khan and Naseeruddin Shah are seen interacting and sharing ideas, thoughts about cinema and the entertainment industry in general. The duo were speaking at an India Today conclave.\n\nBoth Irrfan and Naseeruddin couldn\u2019t help showering praises at each other. Irrfan shared that it was actors like Naseeruddin and Dilip Kumar that had stirred his passion for the performing arts.\n\n\u201cI was looking for something that could give me a direction. His (Naseer\u2019s) performances, Dilip Saheb\u2019s performance gave me the direction that life is a subject, that it is possible to get work by reflecting life.

Irrfan and Naseeruddin had shared screen space in the Vishal Bhardwaj movie Maqbool.\n\nMeanwhile, Naseeruddin Shah had remembered Irrfan in a touching article he had written for The Indian Express. Likening Irrfan to Mozart, Naseeruddin had penned, \u201cWhen I used to watch him act, I used to think of Mozart and (Antonio) Salieri. Salieri used to tell God \u2018Why am I the patron saint of mediocrity? Is this fellow\u2019s random scribbling superior to my hours and hours of labour in composing music?\u2019 I must say that when I watched Irrfan, that\u2019s how I used to feel. I wished that when I was his age, I had been that good. I really admired him in an unqualified manner. I don\u2019t think there is another actor I admired as much as I admired Irrfan.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | When Irrfan Khan said wife Sutapa had a better understanding of a performance\n\nThe late star also spoke briefly about his stint on television during the India Today conclave, and how he felt that \u2018his time\u2019 would never come; \u201cI came here to do cinema, but I was consumed by television and tv was boring. I used to hear things like Subhash Ghai is talking about me \u2014 \u2018Ye ladka kaun hai?\u2019 (who is this guy?), and I used to wait thinking a call would come but it never happened.\u201d\n\nAnd it might seem unlikely to many, but Irrfan actually thought at one point that his face resembled Mithun Chakraborty\u2019s. The latter has been primarily associated with \u2018masala\u2019 movies Irrfan had consciously stayed away from.\n\n\u201c\u2018I used to wonder mera face kisi se milta hai kya, arey ha Mithun se milta hai to ban jaunga main actor (I used to wonder whether my face resembled anyone, and I thought that it looked similar to Mithun\u2019s so that propelled my thought further of becoming an actor). I also used to imitate Mrigayaa\u2019s dialogue. In Mrigayaa, Mithun was not playing a chocolate boy, he was a Naxalite\u2026I used to make my hair straight in order to look like him,\u201d stated Irrfan as he laughed recounting this little anecdote.\n\nTo think that someone of Irrfan\u2019s talent had self-doubt about his capabilities as a professional like the rest of us is an inspiring and humbling reminder of what a human being can achieve.

The two-film franchise not only delivered India\u2019s biggest box office success, it also changed the way we look at the monolith that we call \u2018Indian cinema\u2019. An audiences brought up on a staple diet of Hindi films rarely stepped out to watch Tamil or Telugu films in theatres across back then. There were successes that were not originally Hindi films, but they were just that \u2014 exceptions.\n\nBaahubali, two dubbed Telugu films, changed all that. A pan-India hit that was epic in proportions remains the highest grossing Hindi film till date. It also had an impact the way Indian filmmakers made their films \u2014 from frames to larger-than-life vision. Many even tried to recreate the success of SS Rajamouli film but in vain.\n\nAs the film turns four, we look back at the film which gave us memorable moments, stars in Prabhas, Rana Daggubatti, Ramya and Anushka Shetty and more pop influences then we can count. Now, who doesn\u2019t remember when Ramya Krishna as Sivagami Devi introduced baby Mahendra Baahubali as the next king of Mahishmati?\n\nWhile Rajamouli mounted the film at an epic scale with grandeur to spare, he also put a human story at the heart of it which was relatable. What inspires Prabhas\u2019 Mahendra and Amarendra or Rana Daggubati\u2019s Bhallaladeva is as old as our myths and stories Indians have heard when they were children. To add to it, SS Rajamouli gave us strong women characters who came in all shades. If Sivagami was a mix of a mother\u2019s blind faith and the indomitable will of a fearless queen, Anushka Shetty\u2019s Devasena was the epitome of strength and valour.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Baahubali (@baahubalimovie)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Baahubali (@baahubalimovie)\n\nBut like millions out there, I fell in love with the character of Amarendra Baahubali, whose story of greatness takes over the screen in Baahubali The Conclusion. From the very first frame of the film when he makes his entry as Amarendra Baahubali with \u201cSaaho\u201d song on the vocals of Daler Mehendi, Prabhas wins over our hearts. He exudes respect for people, especially for women, which makes a connect with us.\n\nIn the scene where he speaks against his mother Sivagami for trying to get Devasena married to Bhallaladeva, Prabhas\u2019 Amarendra Baahubali had set an example about how it is important to be true to your dharma. He doesn\u2019t disrespect his mother but chooses to side with what\u2019s right. Does this mean he valued Sivagami any less? Of course, not. He, without a question, lets go of the right to be Mahishmati\u2019s king. And even leaves the kingdom on Sivagami\u2019s command. He was the perfect son, a perfect friend and a supportive brother.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Baahubali (@baahubalimovie)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Baahubali (@baahubalimovie)\n\nBut even after he loses everything, he lives a life of a king as he finds love, respect and his honour in the people of his kingdom.

In 2017, Samantha delivered back-to-back hits with Raju Gari Gadhi 2 and Mersal. She continued the success in 2018 with blockbuster Rangasthalam, Mahanati and U Turn. U Turn, a multi-language thriller film, was perhaps her first thriller and a film that hinged completely on her. While a film being lead by a solo female actor is not new to South\u2019s film industry, for Samantha success of U Turn proved that her popularity is her own and not dependent on a famous male icon. She again went against her image with Super Deluxe and Oh Baby! Her popularity is such that in Majili, when she made her entry in Chaitanya Akkineni\u2019s film, people whistled and threw money, a treatment usually reserved for superstars like Rajinikanth, Vijay and others male A-listers.\n\nOTT debut\n\nIn 2020, Samantha took a leap of faith and made her debut on the OTT platform with a talk show titled Sam Jam. The show, streaming on Aha, was a hit. In fact, the episodes where she hosted Allu Arjun and Naga Chaitanya garnered immense love.\n\nBollywood debut via web series\n\nNot just OTT debut, in 2020, Samantha announced her Bollywood debut with the second season of the much-awaited The Family Man. In the series, which stars Manoj Bajpayee in the lead role, Samantha will be seen performing action, something she did not explore in films till now. \u201cShe spent a lot of time working out, chiseling her body and increasing her fitness. In a way, she was getting trained for martial arts,\u201d Raj and DK had said on Samantha\u2019s Sam and Jam show.\n\n\u201cThere were days when Nagarjuna used to punch on screen, and we used to think that\u2019s how action should be done. And now, we feel the same about Samantha. So, Sam you are giving competition to the men out there,\u201d they concluded.\n\nTelevision debut\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nSamantha showed off her hosting skills much before Sam Jam started streaming on the digital platform. She was seen filling in for her father-in-law and actor Nagarjuna Akkineni for a special episode of Bigg Boss. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d be on the Big Boss stage as host! Only because I was given this responsibility by my Mamagaru.. I could find the strength to overcome my fears \u2026 the fear that I had no experience hosting , the fear of Telugu .. I had never even watched an episode before \ud83d\ude0a.. (ended up doing a marathon 3 days before the show) Thankyou mama for helping me overcome my fears and trusting me with this \ud83d\ude01. And I really need to thank all of you for all the love I received after the episode. I was jumping with joy,\u201d she wrote on Instagram.\n\nA woman of voice\n\nThey say, with power comes responsibility, and Samantha sure understands that. The actor, who is at the peak of her career, has never failed to speak her mind on different occasions. For her, her social media platforms are not mere mediums to promote brands or films but also to address the on-going issues. Be it encouraging women to share their MeToo stories or to support co-actor in moments of distress, Samantha makes her point clear.\n\nOne such example is from the time when Indian film industry was shook with MeToo movement. Samantha tweeted in support of all the women who suffered abuse of any sorts. \u201cI am so happy that more and more women are finding the strength to say # MeToo. Your bravery is commendable. I am sorry though that some people, even other women themselves will shame and burden you with the question of proof and doubt. Just know that you are saving many little girls with your voice. Thank you. I support the #MeTooIndia movement,\u201d the actor tweeted.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nRecently, Samantha also called out people who expect actors to have an opinion on everything. She titled the video as, \u201cWe\u2019re entertainers, Not fact-checkers.\u201d\n\nThe Family Woman\n\nSamantha married into Telugu film industry\u2019s biggest family. She married Naga Chaitanya after dating him for a couple of years. Naga Chaitanya is Nagarjuna Akkineni\u2019s son, who is legendary late actor Akkineni Nageshwara Rao\u2019s son. Samantha married Chaitanya in 2017.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nOn a show, Samantha called Chaitanya \u201cperfect\u201d and narrated how and when she fell in love with him. \u201cHe was very very helpful. I think that experience (of working on Ye Maaya Chesave) took me from being very naive, weak and not knowing to be capable, strong and understanding myself better. He was a part of the journey. That experience nobody else shared with me other than Chay, so he just had to be my husband. I fell in love with him there. That is when I decided I will marry him.\n\nHe knew I liked him. I became very dependant on him. So, it took eight years to come on the same space because I really liked him and he was not in that space. There were times when we wanted to work it out, but there were many factors. It took a long time for us to be in the same space.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, in another talk show, she said Nagarjuna \u201cis the bible on how to live your life.\u201d\n\nBut her life is not just about her husband and her in-laws. Hash, her paw-friend or child (as she calls it), is the most special being in her life, and her social media posts are proof. Here\u2019s a look:\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nBeyond films\n\nSamantha started Pratyusha Support foundation in 2012 to provide medical support for women and children with the help of three doctor friends. She provided the financial support for the programme. She has often involved herself in the philanthropy work. During the 2015 Chennai floods, Samantha was situated in Hyderabad for the shoot of a film, and helped mobilise the Mana Madras Kosam initiative organised by the Telugu film industry. Through the initiative, she participated in gathering relief materials at Ramanaidu Studios and appealed to the Telugu-speaking public to help gather resources to send to Chennai.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nThe actor also has an online fashion brand and an educational initiative. Earlier this year, Samantha announced her association with Isha Foundation.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nFitness freak\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Samantha Akkineni (@samantharuthprabhuoffl)\n\nAfter her films, family and philanthropic work comes Samantha\u2019s dedication towards fitness. Not just her roles, we see her experimenting even in the aspect of fitness.\n\nFinally, on a concluding note, it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to call Samantha an all-rounder. Here\u2019s wishing the star a very happy birthday."}]

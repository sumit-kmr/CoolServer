You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\n\nCovid-19 pandemic has forced the schools and colleges to shut the doors for traditional offline education and move to the digital mode classroom. There are many advantages and disadvantages of online classes. For some students, online courses may create a sense of isolation. Online learning requires time management skills, self-discipline, willpower, and strong motivation to stay focused.Here are some important tips for students to help them learn better through an online class and improve their grades:Though many online classes give you flexibility of timing, it's better to have a disciplined approach and fix the timing of the class. Treat online classes like in-person classes and have a routine just like you would if you were going to class in-person.Create an online discussion forum where students can post questions, have discussion and solve each others doubts. You can study together over video conferencing to get the benefits of studying in a group and have someone to hold you accountable.Though you don't have access to offline library, you teacher may offer various online study materials that you can use to practice and understand the concept better. And if you have any questions related to the study resources, feel free to ask your tutor.To give you a sense of regular offline classroom or lecture hall, have a dedicated study space to help you stay focused when it\u2019s time to study and disconnect when it isn\u2019t. Just make sure the space you choose is not too comfortable or distracting.Without a tutor overlooking you or classmate siting next to you, it\u2019s easy to get distracted with social media, games, food etc. To eliminate or at least minimize these distractions, log off from your social handles and keep your study space separate from other distractions.It may be tempting to skip taking notes when all the resources are available online and can be accessed any time. While all your study materials may be available online but it's still very important to write down notes to engage with the study material and put it in your own words. It will help boost both your comprehension and retention.Have a deadline reminder for all your assignments and exams. In an online class, you need to be extra diligent about monitoring deadlines. Make sure you complete your syllabus in set deadline to avoid damaging your grades later. Put the reminders on your mobile calendar to make sure you don't forget your assignment or exam dates."}, {"Article Image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-82288020,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1407689,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "Article's Title": "Medical students suffer due to limited practical training at hospitals", "Article's Text": "Congratulations!

It stated that while all government and non-government educational institutions, including colleges and universities, will remain closed in the district, direction has been issued to make online classes available during the period of campus closure.Campuses will be shut in at least 15 other districts from Wednesday, after the state education department issued another order to close down all educational institutions in districts where the cumulative total of positive cases in the last 10 days exceeded 300. In view of the fresh directive to save campuses from the second wave of Covid-19, educational institutions, hostels and coaching institutes will remain closed for 15 days from Wednesday (April 28) till May 12 across Kamrup, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur, Nagaon, Tinsukia, Jorhat, Barpeta, Cachar, Karbi Anglong, Golaghat, Darrang, Hojai, Bongaigaon, Nalbari and Sivasagar districts. All of these areas crossed the 300 figure by Monday night.These closure orders, if not reviewed, may jeopardize the plans to conduct the Class 10 and 12 state board examinations, scheduled to begin on May 11. The new academic session in the schools of Assam began on April 1 and thus, there is little pressure on the state government to restart the offline classes soon. However, sources in the education department said that when campuses remain closed, the conduct of the board examinations may draw flak from the public.The Board of Secondary Education, Assam (Seba) will review the Covid situation in the first week of May, before taking a final decision on the Class 10 boards. Seba chairman RC Jain, however, told TOI that they are willing to go ahead to conduct the exams as per the already announced schedule. \u201cWe will review the Covid situation on May 4 in order to take a call on the boards. Everything will depend on the improvement or deterioration of the situation. But I believe that there is a vast difference between conducting regular classes and conducting examinations,\u201d Jain said.Seba recently announced a new sitting arrangement in exam halls to maintain distancing. But Jain informed that the board has also sought the opinion of the health department for conducting the board examination amid the surge.The Assam Higher Secondary Education Council (AHSEC) too, has adopted a wait and watch policy before taking a final decision on the upcoming Class 12 state board examinations. \u201cVery soon we will decide on the exam plans. Closure of the campuses in several districts, as directed by the government, is a new problem,\u201d AHSEC secretary Ramesh Chutia said.All exams under Gauhati University (GU) have been put on hold till further orders. A meeting chaired by GU vice-chancellor Prof. Pratap Jyoti Handique on Tuesday discussed in detail the nature of internet connectivity available to all students. About 2.5 lakh students live in different remote areas. And not all of them have laptops and smart phones. It has been decided that these examinations will be held in the offline mode with 20 days prior notification after the situation reverts to normalcy.\u201cMany of our students are from the remotest corners of the state. For them, the online mode of examination is not feasible at all,\u201d said GU registrar HK Nath.

You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\n\nDelhi University (DU) which opened the admission portal for foreign students on April 8, is planning to finish the admission process by June. Foreign Students Registry (FSR) is the window for admission of foreign nationals in different programmes of study taught in its various colleges, departments and centres of the University.Speaking to Education Times, Amarjiva Lochan, dean, International Relations and Foreign Students Registry, says that admission process is already delayed for foreign students due to Covid-19. They should not suffer due to delayed board results in India.\u201cSome of the foreign applicants have already passed the qualifying examination in their respective countries. Moreover, DU has the provision of 5% supernumerary seats in its colleges for foreign nationals so it will not impact the enrolment of Indian students,\u201d says Lochan. Earlier, DU used to complete 80-90% foreign admission by the end of April. \u201cMostly, Foreign Students Registry (FSR) admission starts in February and close to 80-90% admissions get over by April,\u201d says Lochan.\u201cDU has received new applicants from countries such as Argentina, Mexico, the Netherlands, Malaysia,\u201d says Lochan. The university earlier had students from countries including Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, Bangladesh etc. \u201cMost students from developing countries prefer courses in Computer Science and Bachelor of Management Studies. Among PG students, Political Science is one of the most sought-after courses,\u201d adds Lochan. Last year, the university took various steps including the extension of the application deadline, easing the administrative process to attract foreign nationals. \u201cWith the collective efforts, the university not only retained the foreign enrolments, but surpassed the previous year\u2019s figure. In 2020, DU enrolled 562 students as compared to 556 in 2019,\u201d says Lochan. According to the merit list for the academic session 2020-21, Political Science and Psychology were among the top in the list of the most preferred courses at undergraduate and postgraduate level, respectively. A total of 44 candidates made it to the merit list for BA (H) Psychology and 43 candidates for BA (H) Political Science. For MA Political Science, 29 students made it to the merit list in the academic session 2020-21. For Bachelor of Law programme, 51 students figured in the DU admission list.Students from Afghanistan and Nepal have traditionally been largely representing foreign students on the DU campus. \u201cAvailability of scholarships and easy connectivity are major reasons that can be the reason for maximum applications from the two neighbouring countries,\u201d adds Lochan.Other than these two countries, students from Kenya, Ghana, Tanzania, China, Mongolia, Palestine, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Armenia, Bangladesh, Republic of Korea and Swaziland had applied in the year 2020."}]

What in your view went wrong in terms of anticipation and capacity building?\n\nIndia prepared reasonably well for the pandemic in its early stages. The lockdown gave the medical system time to expand infrastructure, train staff, and build capacity to absorb patients. The rationale for lockdowns across the world in March-April 2020 was to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. It meant taking actions that would bring down the number of cases that needed hospitalisation and treatment enough that they would not breach the limits of the medical capacity of the country. This preparation allowed the country to manage the first wave in 2020, while keeping overall mortality rates relatively low (apart from brief periods of stress in the larger cities).\n\nThe number of new cases began to decline nationwide after September (despite localised spikes in some places), and by January 2021, there was a dramatic reduction in hospital utilisation rates. Vaccinations began in January, and this led to the expectation that India would be able to vaccinate its frontline health workers, and the most vulnerable segments of the population by the summer, so even if a second wave hit, it would not be severe, and the country would be better equipped to handle it.\n\nThree factors belied this expectation: first, the dedicated volunteer networks, special COVID-19 facilities, and emergency measures that the administration and health system had taken, were scaled back and in some cases wound down, just as cases were beginning to rise. Second, the vaccination campaign was slower to roll out, largely because of a lower sense of urgency. And third, we didn\u2019t invest enough resources to study the emergence of new variants quickly enough.\n\nAll these factors were predicated on the assumption that the worst was behind us. So, when the wave began, from a preparedness point of view, we were, in some ways more unprepared than we were towards the end of last year.\n\nWas there enough research being done on why we saw a major dip in the months of January and early February? Did that make the government and people complacent?\n\nThere was research, but there was no overarching compelling explanation for why recorded numbers dipped so rapidly and so much at the start of the year. The last sero-survey carried out by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) showed exposure rates of 1 in 5 amongst the respondents sampled, but with wide variations across urban and rural, and within urban between different categories of populations. So, the prevailing popular theory of \u201cherd immunity\u201d was not really backed by evidence. The falling numbers coincided with a continued opening of the economy; new cases didn\u2019t rise despite increased mobility, reinforcing the sense of confidence. The lack of a compelling explanation for the fall, in my view, led to the willingness of many people to believe that the worst was behind us.\n\nWhen the Lancet Commission on COVID-19 India Task Force was convened in January, several Task Force members expressed their grave concerns that the prevailing optimism was misplaced, and that a second wave was imminent. Unfortunately, those fears have been completely validated.\n\nWhat is harder to understand is why corrective action was not taken at the beginning of this wave when numbers started to rise in Maharashtra and Punjab. There were enough indications that the situation was going to get difficult. And even if no one predicted the intensity of the wave, the fact that it was happening should have immediately triggered actions to limit large gatherings and reinforce safe behaviour. None of that happened till it was too late and we are seeing the consequences play out.\n\nWe are being told that new mutants of the virus are more infectious than the last time around. How much of the current situation, just in terms of spread, can be laid at the door of the mutations?\n\nIt is too early to answer this question precisely. The Lancet Commission Task Force has recommended that the Indian SARS-COV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), led by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), set up in December 2020, be supported so it can achieve its goal of testing 5% of all cases every month on a continuous basis. We also recommend that in the short term, labs are equipped with TaqPath test kits to identify the B.1.1.7 and other variants. Right now, we are a long way from systematically gathering and analysing this information.\n\nWhat public health interventions, do you think, need to be made urgently for the mitigation of some of the appalling shortages in medical resources we see?\n\nIn the short-term, the immediate priority is to save lives. Enough has been said on the shortages that hospitals face immediately, in terms of beds, logistics around the supplies of oxygen, and availability of drugs. The more fundamental issue is of a structure that supports patients at home and helps triage patients effectively, so that only the most critical go to hospital, and those that need to, get the help they need. Mumbai has done that well, and we are seeing the results in terms of hospitalisation rates, and overall management of the pandemic. Reducing movement and activity (through voluntary or imposed closures) is necessary step right now \u2014 to break the chain of transmission and stabilise the numbers. In April, we saw the rise of new cases growing at the rate of nearly 7%. This has to be brought down urgently.\n\nScaling up of vaccinations is also key as a medium-term strategy to boost protection and reduce the severity of illness and eventually (hopefully) transmission rates. The supply constraints that the vaccine manufacturers are facing right now could not have come at a worse time, given the intensity of the wave. We need to ramp up production and distribution urgently. Finally, our health care staff: doctors, nurses, attendants, administrators and ambulance drivers are under enormous stress and strain. Supplementing them with senior residents and medical students, retraining, counselling and supporting them: these are all steps that need to be planned for immediately.\n\nIs the second wave it? Or are more waves and troughs anticipated?\n\nI don\u2019t believe anyone expects this wave to be the last. But the intensity of the next wave will depend on how well we learn the lessons from this one. If we can ramp vaccinations by an order of magnitude over the next few months, prepare our primary care system to effectively supervise home care and triage patients, ensure a steady supply of the inputs that hospitals need to effectively treat patients, and if we can collectively practise COVID-safe behaviours moving forward, the subsequent waves we face can be managed."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg", "Article's Title": "Action sought against Vaikundarajan", "Article's Text": "Mining baron, however, denies removal of minerals, machinery from sealed premises\n\nSeeking action against mining baron S.

Even if people hold marriage as per the schedule, they would hire photographers for a limited time. \u201cEarlier, we were asked to cover rituals held on the eve of marriage, not now.

The government planned to complete the drive over the next six months, informed the Health Minister.\n\n\u201cThe State cabinet has unanimously taken the decision to provide free vaccination to all its citizens above 18 years in the third phase of the vaccination programme. To achieve this, the government needs to purchase at least 12 crore vials, while administering 2 crore vaccine doses each month in order to complete this drive over the next six months,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Tope stressed that despite the Centre announcing the third phase to begin from May 1, it would not be possible to begin the vaccinations on that date as the only two indigenous producers \u2013 Serum Institute of India (which produces \u2018Covishield\u2019) and Bharat Biotech (which rolls out \u2018Covaxin\u2019) \u2013 could not supply the requisite amounts of doses for the smooth conduct of the inoculation drive.\n\n\u201cBharat Biotech, in its Expression of Interest (EOI) to the State government\u2019s request, has said it could only supply us with 10 lakh vaccines in May and the same number in June. From August onwards, the firm has said it could provide us with 20 lakh vaccines every month,\u201d he said, remarking that he hoped to commence the drive only by the end of May.\n\nMr. Tope further informed that the Serum Institute of India (SII) had given a verbal promise of supplying one crore vaccines a month to the Maharashtra government and that the State cabinet had taken the decision to import vaccines to meet its required quantity.\n\n\u201cWhile SII has promised to supply us with one crore vaccines, they have yet to give it in writing. So, in order to procure adequate vaccines, the cabinet has taken the decision to import. The Chief Minister is in talks with the manufactures of the Russian \u2018Sputnik V\u2019 vaccine to see if they can provide us doses in the right quantity at a reasonable price,\u201d said Mr. Tope.\n\nHe said that the State government hoped to procure the \u2018Virafin\u2019 vaccine by Zydus Cadilla in August, along with that of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s \u2018Janssen\u2019 Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe State would have more choices of vaccines and greater quantities would be available by August\u2026we do not want to begin the drive only to shut down vaccination centers, as is happening at the moment. We would commence vaccination only after having a decent stock of doses,\u201d said the Health Minister.\n\nA micro-planning committee comprising of Health Department authorities and senior ministers would be working out the modalities of managing the third phase vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to divide the 18-44 age group into three categories: 18-25 years, 25-35 years and 35-44 years.

Besides private establishments, the State has 13,000 organizations associated with public health department itself,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Mr. Tope and Chief Minister Thackeray exhorted people to avoid needlessly rushing to vaccination centers.\n\n\u201cThere must not be any indiscipline or unwarranted rush at any of the centers.

Almost every district has government and private medical colleges.\n\nHe urged the government to release salary to doctors and medical staff on a timely basis to boost their morale.\n\nBlaming the Central and State governments for the spread of the virus, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked what the State government had done for the last 14 months, since the first wave of the pandemic. \u201cHow many beds have been increased? How many ICU beds have been increased? How much production of oxygen and Remdesivir was increased?\u201d The supply of oxygen was just 300-400 tonnes per day against the demand of 1,400 tonnes, he said.\n\nWith shortage of beds in government and private hospitals, the former Chief Minister suggested to the government to establish beds at schools, colleges, community halls, and marriage halls on a temporary basis till the situation was brought under control. The bed capacity should be increased by 50%.\n\nOn shortage of ventilators and oxygen, Mr. Siddaramaiah suggested to the government to import both items to ensure timely treatment. Following shortage of Remdesivir, he urged the Centre to stop export of the vaccine. The country had exported 11 lakh doses of vaccine, he said and urged the Centre to step up its production to cater the demand in the country.\n\nOn patients being charged \u20b940,000 to \u20b950,000 per day in some private hospitals, the Congress leader urged the government to issue guidelines to private hospitals for regulation of fees.\n\nOn providing vaccination, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the State government would be buying 10 crore doses of vaccine by paying \u20b9400 per dose. This would cost the exchequer \u20b94,000 crore, which was collected from the tax-payers. The Centre had said it would allocate \u20b935,000 crore for vaccination.

It was the time when the sudden rush for vaccines started, which led to serious troubles with people crowding at many vaccine centres.In the last 24 hours ending 2 pm, 1,38,190 samples were tested and the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) was 25.34 per cent.

(Express photo/Representational Image)\n\nThe ongoing lockdown and the demand destruction which follows has once again come to haunt the dairy industry. The sector, which was enjoying good returns till about a month ago is now worried about a possible longish backlash if the Covid-induced lockdowns continue.\n\nFaced with an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases, state-after-state went for movement restrictions or lockdown. As shops, restaurants and hotels remained closed, uptake of commodities like butter, cheese, paneer saw a dip. The sale of liquid milk has also been hit due to the closure of tea shops and sweet marts. Even the soaring temperature has not resulted in good sales of ice cream which is a money churner for the dairies during summer.\n\nR S Sodhi, managing director of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation \u2014 the cooperative giant which markets milk and milk products under brand Amul \u2014 said their ice cream sales are almost one-third of what they were in 2019. \u201cOf course we can\u2019t compare the sales of 2020 as the nationwide lockdown had already kicked in back then. But ice cream sales have been hit,\u201d he said.\n\nItems like cheese, butter, paneer and skimmed milk powder (SMP), which form the bulk of what the industry calls as HORECA (Hotel Restaurant and Catering) sector, have reported the lowest sales. The direct result of this slump in demand has been a collapse of commodity prices.\n\nSodhi admitted that the low demand for SMP has brought down the prices from the range of Rs 260-265/kg correct to the present rates of Rs 225-230/kg. Other dairies have reported prices slumping to Rs 215-220/kg. This correction in domestic markets comes even as international SMP prices continue to remain robust.\n\nAuctions on April 20th at the global online platform Global Dairy Trade, which is owned by New Zealand\u2019s cooperative dairy giant Fonterra, has seen a slight correction of $3,365/tonne from the previous high of $3,367/tonne on April 6. These are the highest prices the platform had seen in the last five years.\n\nWhile demand destruction continues to haunt the sector, some dairies blame the fear psychosis for the distress sales. Dasarth Mane, chairman and managing director of Indapur based Sonai Dairy, claimed that the smaller dairies which are short on finances are selling their stock of SMP to raise funds.\n\n\u201cThis has to be stopped otherwise the commodities market would collapse and farmer\u2019s prices would tank again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Stay updated with the latest Pune news. Follow Express Pune on Twitter here and on Facebook here. You can also join our Express Pune Telegram channel here.\n\nAt present, India has around 1.15 lakh tonnes of SMP and just about 30,000 tonnes of white butter stocks.\n\nSince the start of the lockdown, dairies have taken to slashing their procurement prices to make ends meet. Thus farmers who were paid around Rs 30/liter for their milk with 3.5 per cent fat and 8.5 SNF (solid not fat) are not commanding prices of around Rs 25-27/-liter. While Mane says prices would not go down below Rs 25, other dairies are uncertain about how long would the lockdown induced demand destruction last."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-WHO-INDIA-REUTERS-1200.jpeg", "Article's Title": "Covid second wave: How High Courts have taken up matters relating to shortage of essential supplies", "Article's Text": "A patient wearing an oxygen mask is wheeled inside a COVID-19 hospital for treatment, amidst the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Ahmedabad, India, April 26, 2021. (Image: REUTERS)\n\nWith many state governments struggling with rising Covid numbers, several High Courts are hearing cases related to shortage of Covid-essentials. The most common issues brought before the courts are the shortage of oxygen and other life-saving drugs, and in turn, the courts have come down heavily on the state governments over their \u2018shoddy\u2019 management.\n\nHere\u2019s how different courts have taken up matters related to Covid-19.\n\nDelhi\n\nThe Delhi High Court on Tuesday pulled up the Aam Aadmi Party government in the national capital over its handling of the Covid-19 crisis, saying its confidence was \u201cshaken\u201d and that if the government cannot manage the situation, the court will ask the Centre to step in.\n\n\u201cSet your house in order. Enough is enough. If you cannot manage it, tell us, then we will ask the central government to send their officers in and do it. We will ask them to take over. We cannot let people die like this,\u201d a division bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.\n\nThe court noted that the government has failed to check the alleged mismanagement in the distribution of medical oxygen and rampant black marketing of oxygen cylinders and essential Covid-19 drugs in Delhi. The court asked the UT government to take over Seth Air Products, a cylinder-supplying unit in Dwarka, which, it said, could be resorting to black marketing.\n\nIt also sought a report from the state government on the deaths in hospitals on account of oxygen shortage.\n\nGujarat\n\nHearing a public interest litigation taking suo motu cognisance of Covid-19 upsurge in Gujarat, a division bench of the Gujarat High Court Tuesday called out the state government for not filing a proper response, saying \u201cyour affidavit does not reflect any of the ground realities\u2026 It is giving a rosy picture\u2026\u201d\n\nUrging the state government to think of ways to break the chain, the bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said that municipal corporations cannot follow a policy of admission only through 108.\n\nAddressing advocate general Kamal Trivedi representing the state, Chief Justice Nath said, \u201cYou say government hospitals are admitting patients who are coming in private vehicles also. Now AMC (Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation) insists that only patients coming in 108 ambulances will be admitted\u2026 Why? Is the corporation not under the supervision and control of the state\u2026 we also pointed out that 108 must attend first to critical patients\u2026 There is no response to this in the affidavit\u2026\u201d\n\nIt also pulled up the state on medical oxygen scarcity. \u201cIn Rajkot people are running from pillar to post, they are not getting oxygen in any of the hospitals\u2026 people are paying 10 times for an oxygen cylinder\u2026 why are bottlers are allowed to give oxygen to private persons?\u2026What is the system doing? Everything is on paper, nothing is on ground reality\u2026 Doctors say he (a patient) has not come in 108, let him die\u2026 Everybody has to be attended to, whosoever is critical, irrespective of which vehicle he has come.\u201d\n\nThe court also noted that \u201ctesting numbers are the same, from April 12 to April 27\u201d.\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nOn April 19, the Allahabad High Court pulled up the Uttar Pradesh government for its approach in dealing with rising coronavirus cases and ordered a lockdown in five cities \u2014 Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur \u2014 till April 26.\n\nHearing a PIL on the \u201cinhuman\u201d condition at quarantine centres and the state of Covid treatment, a Division Bench of Justices Ajit Kumar and Siddhartha Varma said that while ordering a lockdown was the government\u2019s prerogative, it was disappointed by the measures taken since its last order, calling them an \u201ceyewash\u201d.\n\nThe court further said that \u201cthose in power must shun the attitude of \u2018my way or no way\u2019 and should welcome suggestions from all the quarters\u201d.\n\nHowever, the HC\u2019s order was later stayed by a Supreme Court directive after the UP government\u2019s protest.\n\nTamil Nadu\n\nThe Madras High Court came down heavily on the Election Commission for \u201cnot stopping political parties\u201d from violating Covid protocols during their campaign rallies for Assembly polls in four states and a Union Territory over the last month. The court said that murder charges should probably be imposed on the panel for being \u201cthe only institution responsible for the situation that we are in today\u201d.\n\nRemarking that the panel has been \u201cthe most irresponsible over the last few months in not stopping political parties from wanton abuse of the Covid-19 protocol\u201d, a bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said: \u201cYou should be put up on murder charges probably.\u201d\n\nThe court also directed the Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments to consider declaring complete lockdown for two days on May 1 and May 2, when counting of votes will be taken up.\n\nThe Supreme Court, on the other hand, has said the hearing of matters related to shortage of supplies in different High Courts was \u201ccreating some confusion\u201d and \u201cdiversion of resources\u201d.\n\nA bench led by former CJI S A Bobde, who recently vacated his post, said it may withdraw to itself some issues from the High Courts, while noting in its order that, \u201cDrugs, oxygen and vaccination availability and distribution are being carried out by government including the Central government according to protocols established by the health authorities.\u201d\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, a bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud, Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said the apex court does not intend to supplant or substitute different High Courts to monitor the Covid management of their respective states, Live Law reported."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/covishield-express-photo-1200.jpg", "Article's Title": "PIL in Bombay HC seeks uniform price for Covid vaccines by SII and Bharat Biotech", "Article's Text": "The petition sought directions to the Central government to acquire entire supply and control vaccine prices.

Union Minister G Kishan Reddy had said when the bill was introduced in parliament that the amendments would lead to transparency and clarity in governance in the NCT of Delhi and enhance public accountability.\n\nThe minister said Delhi is not a full-fledged state and does not have full power and the executive powers of the L-G of Delhi are different from the powers of governors of the state. Explaining the rationale behind the bill, he said the amendments have been brought to remove ambiguities in the existing Act and stressed that changes in the law have been sought in the spirit of what has been said in a Supreme Court judgment.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party has said it plans to approach the Supreme Court against the legislation, describing it as an \"unconstitutional\" attempt to make the Delhi government \"administratively impotent\" by a political party made \"electorally impotent\" by the people of the national capital.\n\nThe Congress, Trinamool Congress, Shiv Sena, DMK and other opposition parties also termed the bill \"unconstitutional\" and claimed it will fail judicial scrutiny.

Within minutes, they were informed that barring a few, all shots had run out. They subsequently made frantic runs to other centres before they finally got a jab from the Medical College on College Street. All this in the middle of a raging second wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNobody was willing to listen to us at all. At the centres, no social distancing norms were followed,\u201d he said.\n\nOver 2600 km away, at the Jimmy George Indoor Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday, Covid-19 protocols were blatantly violated as hundreds of people, many of them above 60 years of age with comorbidities, flocked to the centre from 7 am to get a shot. The bizarre reason for the crowd was that a majority of them had been provided the same time-slot online. With no access to drinking water or seating, at least three persons fainted in the queue and had to be admitted to hospitals.\n\nJimmy George Indoor Stadium vaccination centre.

It seems everyone was given the same time-slot,\u201d an 80-year-old woman told a local TV reporter.\n\nAs India tries to accelerate its massive vaccination programme in the middle of a devastating second Covid-19 wave, ground reports from states indicate a complex set of problems ranging from shortage of doses to glitches on the registration portal to panic and fear of the vaccines running out. If the initial weeks of vaccination saw a general reluctance among the public, the severity of the pandemic\u2019s second wave has forced them to flock to vaccination centres, flouting the very rules meant to keep them safe. And to top it off, the Centre will open vaccination to everyone above the age of 18 from May 1, even as lakhs of people in the 45-60 and above 60 high-priority age groups still await the jab.\n\nReal hurdle is procuring enough stock\n\nIn Assam, which has administered roughly 21 lakh doses till date, top ministers have expressed doubts about starting vaccination for those in the 18-45 age group in the first week of May, purportedly due to depleting stocks.\n\n\u201cVaccine order has been given to Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute. When they provide us the vaccines, only then can we begin the vaccination. Today, the Centre has given a guideline, based on which\u2026it will be ascertained what amount of vaccine each state will get,\u201d said Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.\n\nAs of April 26, the state had 2.57 lakh doses, which as per the average rate of vaccination in Assam would last just three days.\n\nA top health official said the two existing vaccines, Covishield (of Serum Institute) and Covaxin (of Bharat Biotech), arriving in alternating batches has also been an issue leading to shortage. \u201cFor example, during Bihu in mid-April, we received a large batch of Covishield vaccine. So those who came for their second shot of Covaxin had to be turned back. Currently, shots of both vaccines are available. The demand has risen a lot and will continue to do so as vaccines open up for the 18-45 age group,\u201d said Munindra Nath Ngatey, director of health services (family welfare) in the Assam government.\n\nIn neighbouring Manipur too, officials are aware of the dangers of crowding at immunisation centres. Even a moderate surge in infections can wreak havoc on the healthcare systems there. \u201cWe have received reports that in some of the centres, vaccination went on till 8 pm on Monday. That\u2019s because people out of fear are randomly walking into centres without understanding the capacity. We have plans to help ease the situation,\u201d said Dr Th Nandakishore, an immunisation officer, on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf the vaccination rate climbs above the average, the current stocks will last for 10 days,\u201d he said.\n\nIn faraway Telangana, the situation is no different. The state faces an acute shortage of doses due to limited supply as well as rising demand for the vaccine among the public in the second wave. Despite the state claiming to have the capacity to immunise 10 lakh people a day, it is giving the jab only to about 2 lakh people a day as a result of limited supply from the Centre and the manufacturers.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to administer more than 2 lakh vaccine doses a day, but we are getting stocks to meet only our daily requirements. Today, we are left with only 1.5 lakh doses and we are expecting another 1.5 lakh doses by tonight,\u201d said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, the state\u2019s director of public health, on Tuesday.\n\nAt an urban primary health centre in Hyderabad, the presiding medical officer underlined the scarcity in doses. \u201cToday, we don\u2019t have any Covishied vials left. Many people had to be sent back. We are administering only the second dose of Covaxin today. Compared to before, the supply is less. We get daily instructions on which vaccine and which dose to administer for the day. We are managing to give away a maximum of 150 to 200 doses a day,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nSo far, Telangana has administered around 42 lakh doses, covering just about 10 per cent of the state\u2019s population. It has announced free vaccines to the public irrespective of age or nativity, setting aside Rs 2,500 crore for the same.\n\n\u201cWe are working on modalities to vaccinate people in the 18-45 age group. There will be a decision soon. But it is not possible to include this age group in the drive with the same supply of vaccines we are receiving now. We need more clarity on the availability of vaccines to be procured by the state,\u201d said Dr Rao. On Tuesday, chief secretary Somesh Kumar held a meeting with Dr Krishna Ella, MD, Bharat Biotech, requesting him to ensure maximum doses to the state. The company is headquartered in Hyderabad.\n\nIn neighbouring Karnataka, several district health officers indicated that the vaccination for the 18-45 age group could be delayed by a week, though officially the government says it has adequate stocks. No statistics on existing stocks were available.\u201cWe have been given no guidelines on this yet. Senior officers have told us that procurement will take more time,\u201d an official said.\n\nHealth Minister K Sudhakar told indianexpress.com that the state has placed an order for one crore doses of Covishield with SII. On procurement of Covaxin, the state is yet to spell out its stand. \u201cTill date, we have inoculated 50 per cent of our healthcare workers, 30 per cent of frontline workers and 4 per cent of people aged above 60 and aged between 45-59 (with comorbidities) with both doses,\u201d Sudhakar said.\n\nWhile Karnataka has administered over 88 lakh doses, statistics show there is a sharp fall in those who have taken the second dose among the high-priority age groups. Only 15 per cent of those above 60 and five per cent of those in the 45-60 age category have taken the second jab. \u201cWe need to spread better awareness on why taking the second dose of the vaccine is so important,\u201d said Dr Giridhar R Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister E Palaniswami has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting the Centre to supply the required quantity of vaccines for all three age groups. A budgetary provision of Rs 35,000 crore has been made to fund the vaccine supply, he said.\n\n\u2018Things will be tough from here on\u2019\n\nAs those in the 18-45 age group open up for inoculation across India on May 1, there is little clarity among health officials at the grassroot level on how to go about it. There\u2019s still a significant section among the high-priority groups with comorbidities who haven\u2019t received their first or second doses.\n\n\u201cThere is no provision as of now within the (Co-WIN) software to give priority to those who have to take the second dose,\u201d said Dr Santhosh, a health officer in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala, indicating that those who manage to schedule appointments on the portal will have access to the jab first.\n\nAt a vaccination centre in Kottayam district. (Express Photo) At a vaccination centre in Kottayam district. (Express Photo)\n\nKerala, which has inoculated 16% of the population with 69 lakh doses so far, may open up vaccination in the 18-45 age group for those with serious comorbidities first. But it\u2019s not clear how it will do so, considering all registrations are done via the portal. The state suspended mass vaccination camps with on-the-spot registrations last week after districts like Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram reported swelling crowds, breaking all Covid-19 protocols. Officials feared such camps would turn out to be super-spread events especially when the state\u2019s test positivity rate has remained above 20% for the last two weeks. New daily infections in the state crossed 30,000 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cEarlier, people were more disciplined. But now, they fear that vaccine doses are ending and are creating panic. Due to crowds assembling, we had major law and order issues. To manage crowds, we switched completely to online registrations,\u201d said Dr Santhosh.\n\nIn Kerala, officials are creating short-term sessions on the portal depending on available stocks. As a result, people are finding it difficult to schedule appointments in nearby centres. Some have resorted to travelling outside their districts to get their family members vaccinated.\n\nIntense Covid Vaccination drive at a primary school in Kariyam, a suburb of Thiruvanathapuram. (PRD Kerala) Intense Covid Vaccination drive at a primary school in Kariyam, a suburb of Thiruvanathapuram. (PRD Kerala)\n\n\u201cWe are getting doses that last only one or two days. So, we are creating sessions online only on the basis of doses we have. If we create a session today, people can book appointments for the next day. This will go on until we get a larger volume of doses,\u201d said Dr Mathew, officer in charge of vaccination in Kottayam district.\n\nA senior health officer in Kerala said there are \u2018problems from head-to-toe\u2019 in the vaccine distribution in the country. \u201cFrom now on, if SII makes 100 doses, half of them would go to the Centre which will be distributed across the 30 states and UTs. The remaining half go to the private sector and state governments. Many states have already booked lakhs of such doses. There are problems from head to toe in the distribution of the vaccine. Things will be tougher going forward,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cInitially, we would literally beg people to come and take the vaccine and they would be arrogant about it. But now, the situation has changed. They realise how precious it is,\u201d he underlined.\n\n(Inputs from Adrija Roychowdhury in Kolkata, Jimmy Leivon in Imphal, Ralph Alex Arakal in Bengaluru and Janardhan Kaushik in Chennai)"}, {"Article Image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/k605e1sg_pm-modi_625x300_25_April_21.jpg", "Article's Title": "India, Russia To Establish \"2+2\" Dialogue In Boost To Partnership", "Article's Text": "PM Modi also discussed the evolving COVID-19 situation with President Putin (File)\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday thanked President Vladimir Putin for Russia's help and support in India's fight against COVID-19 as the two leaders agreed to establish a \"2+2 ministerial dialogue\" between foreign and defence ministers to add further momentum to the bilateral strategic partnership.\n\nIn a series of tweets after a telephonic conversation with Putin, PM Modi said they reviewed diverse bilateral cooperation, especially in the area of space exploration and renewable energy sector, including in hydrogen economy.\n\nThe cooperation on the Sputnik-V vaccine will assist humanity in battling the pandemic, PM Modi said.\n\n\"Had an excellent conversation with my friend President Putin today.

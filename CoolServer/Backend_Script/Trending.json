Her unease about her ex-husband's ties to Epstein dates back to at least 2013, the paper said.\n\nThe New York Times reported in October 2019 that the billionaire had met with Epstein several times, and once stayed late at his New York townhouse. A spokeswoman for Microsoft Corp. co-founder said at the time that the meetings had centered on philanthropy. Epstein had died in jail two months prior while awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking.\n\nThe divorce was negotiated during the pandemic, involving legal teams working with a mediator to divide their fortune, which the Bloomberg Billionaires Index pegs at $145 billion.\n\nThe couple said that they plan on remaining co-chairs and trustees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Billionaire Warren Buffett serves as the foundation's third trustee. All three have vowed to give away the vast majority of their wealth.\n\nIn the days after the split was announced, a holding company that Bill Gates created transferred equity stakes in four different companies, worth more than $2 billion in aggregate, to Melinda French Gates, Bloomberg News has reported. The bulk of it is from about 14.1 million shares in Canadian National Railway Co.\n\nDays before he died in a New York jail, Epstein named a little-known biotech venture capitalist named Boris Nikolic as backup executor of his will. Nikolic had worked as a science adviser to Bill Gates and more recently funded more than a dozen firms in gene editing and other health technologies.\n\nIn an emailed statement at the time, Nikolic told Bloomberg that Epstein had not consulted him about the will and that he had no intention to fulfill the duties.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

    "Text": "The decision by India and the EU to recast the stalled bilateral trade and investment agreement (BTIA) into three separate deals could favour the latter with its focus to have an investment pact with India after inking a similar deal with China.\n\nIn the first India-EU leaders\u2019 meeting on Saturday, the two sides agreed to resume talks separately on trade, investment and geographical indications (GIs), which were earlier part of the BTIA before talks collapsed in 2013 after six years of negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe agreed to resume negotiations for a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade agreement that would respond to the current challenges. We agreed that to create the required positive dynamic for negotiations, it is imperative to find solutions to long-standing market access issues. We also agreed to the launch of negotiations on a standalone investment protection agreement. We also agreed to start negotiations on a separate agreement on geographical indications, which could be concluded separately or integrated into the trade agreement, depending on the pace of negotiations,\" according to a joint statement by India and the EU.\n\n\u201cAfter the Cairn and Vodafone tax disputes, the EU is under severe pressure from member countries to conclude a high-quality investment agreement with India that protects their investments in India and includes a strong investor-state dispute settlement mechanism to which India is opposed to,\" a trade official associated with a government-run think tank said under condition of anonymity.\n\nThe EU had raised strong objection after India unilaterally terminated its 57 bilateral investment treaties (BITs), including those with EU members. India brought out a new model BIT in December 2015, intending to replace its existing BITs and future investment treaties, after foreign investors opted for international arbitration alleging discrimination and citing commitments made by India to others in bilateral treaties.\n\n\u201cGI should have been part of an intellectual property chapter. EU has been demanding automatic recognition for their GIs such as liquor products and cheese. Most of India\u2019s GIs are textiles and handicraft products, which EU may not recognize. EU will recognize only agricultural GIs. If the deal is along the line of mutually recognizing each other\u2019s agricultural GIs, it is difficult to see India benefiting. Our law does not have any provision of automatic recognition of GIs from other countries. One has to go through the process of applying to the patent authority,\" he said.\n\nHowever, one comprehensive deal is difficult as negotiations can get stuck in many areas such as e-commerce, said Arpita Mukherjee, professor at Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.\n\n\u201cIn this manner, at least we can close some deals, which can be implemented on conclusion,\" she said.\n\nTrade is now a more vexed issue than in 2013 when negotiations broke down, said Biswajit Dhar, professor of economics at JNU. \u201cEarlier, there was no political commitment on part of the government to protect the industry. Right now, there is a political commitment through initiatives such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes,\" he said.\n\nThe focus seems to be more on process than substance, said a former trade secretary on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cAt present, this appears to be a political plank to be seen to move away from inertia in trade deals,\" he said.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

Any overzealous, though well-meaning, judicial intervention may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences... in absence of any expert advice or administrative experience, leaving doctors, scientists, experts and executive very little room to find innovative solutions on the go,\" the centre said.\n\n\"Pricing of vaccines is not only reasonable but uniform across the country (after) government persuasion with two vaccine companies,\" the centre added, noting that several states had announced plans to vaccinate the 18-45 age group for free.\n\nThe Supreme Court last week directed the centre to reconsider prices - \"to ensure it withstands scrutiny of Articles 14 (equality before law) and Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty)\".\n\nThat was after manufacturers Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech announced vastly different prices for the centre, states and private hospitals.\n\nWhile the centre continues to spend only Rs 150 per dose for either Serum Institute's Covishield or Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, states must pay Rs 400 per dose for Covaxin and private hospitals Rs 1,200. Covishield costs Rs 300 per dose for states and Rs 600 for private hospitals.\n\nShortage of vaccine doses has forced vaccination centres in several states to shut down (File)\n\nPrices for states and private hospitals were originally higher and were reduced only after outrage.\n\nThe vast difference in prices also triggered a political storm, with the Congress accusing the centre of \"vaccine profiteering\" and sarcastically reminding it of the \"one nation, one price\" war cry.\n\nThe centre pointed out it would get 50 per cent of vaccine supply and that this would be supplied to states for free. However, it made no comment on the higher prices of the remaining 50 per cent.\n\nLast week the Supreme Court said compelling states to negotiate with manufacturers, on grounds of promoting competition and making it attractive for new manufacturers, would adversely affect those in the 18-44 age group, whose vaccination has only just begun.\n\nIndia began vaccination in January and has administered over 17 crore doses so far but the pace has been questioned, with states running out of stock and shutting down centres.\n\nSeveral, including national capital Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan, deferred the start of the third phase over a lack of doses.\n\nSo far two vaccine options are available, with a third - Russia's Sputnik V - having been cleared for emergency use and expected to be rolled out soon. In its affidavit the centre also said it is in consultation with manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to bring in their products.\n\nThe vaccination policy has been criticised by international medical journal The Lancet, which called it \"botched\" and said the government had vaccinated less than two per cent of the population so far.\n\nThe Supreme Court is hearing issues surrounding vaccination and the availability of medical resources - hospital beds and oxygen - as the country battles a huge wave of daily Covid cases.",

Among the items recovered are: 520 bedsheets, 127 kurtas, 52 white sarees and other articles of clothing,\" Circle Officer Alok Singh told a posse of reporters.\n\nPutting the articles to a good wash and post ironing them, the men would again sell it using a Gwalior company's label, said the officer.\n\nThe police also found that some clothing merchants from the area had cut a deal with these men and paid them Rs 300 for a day's loot, he said.\n\n\"Of the seven arrested three are from the same family. These people have been stealing for last 10 years. Since, they have been arrested during coronavirus crisis, other than stealing they will also be charged under the Epidemic Act,\" said Mr Singh.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the Uttar Pradesh government further extended the statewide curfew till May 17 to cut the chain of transmission.",

    "Text": "India has recorded over 2.66 crore Covid cases since the pandemic broke.\n\nAnger over the scale of devastation in the fierce second wave of Covid and its impact on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has caused deep disquiet in the ranks of the ruling BJP and its ideological mentor Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), sources say. In seven years of PM Modi in power, public perception and election results have never spooked the powerful \"Sangh Parivar\" this much.\n\nSources say the BJP and RSS are concerned with the perception that the government dropped the ball on Covid, given that almost everyone in the ruling party's core support base is affected by the deadly pandemic. The middle class are the worst-hit -- and now the virus is spreading to the villages, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\n\n\"If you lose someone, the grief and anger remains for a long period and it can be expressed in any form,\" a leader told NDTV, implying that there is a big worry in the ranks about the pandemic costing the BJP in elections.\n\nWhile there are still three years to the next Lok Sabha polls (2024), when PM Modi will seek a third term, states like Uttar Pradesh are due to vote next year.\n\nIf the results of the UP Panchayat polls are any indication, the BJP has reason to worry.\n\nThe discontent has floated to the surface. Union Minister Santosh Gangwar's letter to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath flagging oxygen shortage, \"black-marketing\" of medical equipment and delays in admitting Covid patients in his constituency Bareilly went viral.\n\nLeaders say there is a strong belief that any damage control will require a shuffle in which some ministers must go and make way for new faces.\n\nThe Covid emergency has exposed the poor health infrastructure and unpreparedness of the government, leaders admit.\n\nHealth is a state subject but that argument does not wash, they believe, since it is the Centre that had been leading the fight against Covid since last year. \"People are disappointed with the central leadership and they blame lack of action on their part for the current situation, which has gone out of our hands,\" sources said.\n\nPM Modi's campaign in West Bengal while Covid cases were spiraling in the country has sent a \"wrong message\", senior leaders fear. Top BJP leaders were campaigning in West Bengal and attending huge rallies and roadshows without masks, prioritizing votes over public safety, and the imagery across global media could not have been worse.\n\nThese leaders also blame lack of communication within the government. \"The Principal Scientific Adviser K Vijay Raghavan warns us about the third wave but he never talked about the second wave,\" a leader lashed out.\n\nThere is an unsettling perception that the BJP's famed machinery is invisible on the ground, and so are its leaders. They are not seen extending help to people this time, unlike last year when the party organization arranged food packets and other relief during the lockdown.\n\nThe government's mismanagement is also evident in what leaders call a \"botched-up vaccination drive\" tangled in rules and regulations.\n\nVaccine production capacity should have been enhanced when there was time, the leaders point out.\n\nThose in the government have strongly defended the Centre's Covid response. They say the perceived ill-preparedness was mainly because of zero warning about the magnitude of the second wave. \"It is a fact that the government was not prepared for the second wave but now all hands are on the deck,\" a minister said.\n\n\"The oxygen supply is being strengthened. Vaccination drive will be smoother. Our vaccine basket has been increased and we will get more vaccines in the coming months,\" he said, adding that the Prime Minister was personally monitoring the efforts.\n\nPM Modi \"cut short his Bengal campaign as soon as it was brought to his notice\", leaders say, and persuaded seers to wind down the mega Kumbh Mela - a religious gathering on the banks of river Ganga that heightened super-spreader fears.\n\n\"It is understood that people are angry and in pain, but the government is trying its best to extend all possible help. BJP-rules states are in the forefront,\" they say. The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government, for instance, has launched a special drive in the villages to trace, test and treat on a large scale.\n\nThe leaders accuse opposition-ruled states of \"playing politics\" at this hour of crisis and putting their failure at the door steps of the Centre - they name Delhi and Maharashtra.\n\n\"Despite public health being state subject, the Central government has been proactive in Covid management as a pandemic requires national level coordination and substantial resources,\" Union Minister Prakash Javadekar has written in a column in The Indian Express.",

    "Text": "The Governor has said he has the authority to sanction prosecution of the four leaders. (FILE)\n\nWest Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar - known for his frequent collision with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee - has given his nod to the CBI to prosecute four erstwhile ministers of her government in the Narada tapes scandal.\n\nTwo of the former ministers, now facing CBI prosecution, were sworn in on Monday by the Governor himself. Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim were named in a list of 43 ministers released on Sunday.\n\nThe sanction and its timing is raising eyebrows, coming as it does just after Mamata Banerjee's resounding victory in the assembly elections that had turned into a direct fight between her and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and also because Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla is yet to sanction the prosecution of Suvendu Adhikari, a former Trinamool Congress minister who is now a BJP MLA from Nandigram.\n\nMr Adhikari was a Trinamool MP in Lok Sabha at the time of the commission of the crime. He beat Mamata Banerjee at Nandigram by less than 2,000 votes.\n\nIn 2014, a journalist from Delhi came to Kolkata, posed as a businessman planning to invest in Bengal, gave wads of cash to seven Trinamool MPs, four ministers, one MLA and a police officer as bribe and taped the entire operation. The tapes were released just before the 2016 assembly elections in the state.\n\nThe two other former ministers whom the Governor has now cleared for prosecution are Madan Mitra, a Trinamool MLA not named minister in the new government, and Sovan Chatterjee who left Trinamool in August 2019, joined the BJP but quit in March. He did not contest the just-concluded polls.\n\n\"Governor accorded sanction for prosecution... being the appointing authority of ministers @MamataOfficial under article 164 and thus competent authority,\" the Governor tweeted on Sunday evening.\n\nGovernor accorded sanction for prosecution of Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra & Sovan Chatterjee being appointing authority of Ministers \u2066@MamataOfficial\u2069 under Article 164 & thus competent authority\n\n\n\nMedia reports that sanction was for being MLA is incorrect. pic.twitter.com/vqEg7Cv6OW \u2014 Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1) May 9, 2021\n\nHe was responding, a press release by Raj Bhavan said, to some media reports that he had given his sanction for prosecution because all four where members of the legislative assembly at the time of commission of crime.\n\nJust as the Speaker of Lok Sabha has to sanction prosecution of any MP, the Speaker of the state assembly should sanction prosecution of MLAs. But in the Narada scam, the CBI did not ask the Bengal assembly Speaker for sanction but approached the Governor instead.\n\nThe Governor has said he has the authority to sanction prosecution not because the four leaders named were MLAs but because they were ministers sworn in by him in 2011.\n\nOf the seven Trinamool MPs named in the Narada case, six were from Lok Sabha and Mukul Roy from Rajya Sabha. Mukul Roy is now with BJP and just elected MLA. There has been no action against him. In the sting tapes, he was not actually seen taking cash.\n\nOf six Lok Sabha MPs, Sultan Ahmed has died. The CBI has sought to prosecute Suvendu Adhikari, Sougata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Prasun Banerjee and Aparupa Poddar. The Lok Sabha Speaker has not granted sanction.\n\nThe four former ministers taped taking bribes were Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim, Sovan Chatterjee and Madan Mitra.\n\nThe MLA involved was Iqbal Ahmed. The police officer was SMH Mirza.",

    "Text": "Covid-19 related deaths in India are expected to double in the coming weeks. People across socioeconomic classes are being cremated en masse in large holes in the ground. The ordeal doesn\u2019t even end with death. Medical bills are piling up, a burden large enough to tip working-class families into multi-generational poverty. Younger adults desperate for vaccines are effectively being forced to pay for them, while those most at risk aren\u2019t adequately insured. The state\u2019s threadbare safety net has all but collapsed.\n\nIn normal times, most Indians use savings, borrow and call on friends and family to pay for health care, assuming it\u2019s accessible. Out-of-pocket expenses are among the highest in the world. More than 60% of the population isn\u2019t covered by insurance. Government workers can get some protection under a few different plans, but most others, including the self-employed, pay for their own treatment. Costs are rising because of a growing dependence on private hospitals and clinics.\n\nTwo years ago, after several failed attempts at universal coverage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration unveiled what it called the world\u2019s largest health insurance plan, targeting over 107 million people \u2014 the poorest 40% of the population. It was meant to be a better version of a decade-old policy that fell short in terms of the amount reimbursed and its cap on the number of people enrolled from one household. Under the new plan, families are covered for up to 500,000 rupees ($6,670) for medical procedures. Eligibility was widened and is based on several \u201cdeprivation\" criteria in rural and urban areas.\n\nYet the new policy hasn't \u201ceffectively improved\" access to health care, according to a working paper by Duke University researchers. To begin with, the eligibility criteria rely on a 10-year-old census, and exclude many potential participants because of inconsistent data. What\u2019s more, outpatient services, which account for 60% of out-of-pocket expenditure, aren\u2019t included. Another area of concern is the program\u2019s dependence on private hospitals. Finally, if the insurance did fully cover its intended beneficiaries, the cost would far exceed budget allocations.\n\nFor a country battling the most severe surge of the pandemic the world has seen, it's hard to start thinking about long-term changes. India is now considering setting up a fund worth at least 1 trillion rupees to support the uninsured, the Hindustan Times reported last week. Helping the population through a third wave is the obvious priority. But now is the time for policy makers to get serious about a minimum \u2014 and rising \u2014 standard of care for everyone.\n\nAs an alternative model, Taiwan stands out, and not just because of its globally acknowledged success in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Although its population of 23 million isn\u2019t comparable to India\u2019s 1.4 billion, Taiwan\u2019s fundamentally strong health care holds valuable lessons.\n\nAll long-term residents are covered under a comprehensive national insurance. Co-payments on prescriptions as well as physician visits are reasonable, and capped at about $7 and $14, respectively. Hospital stays, too, have cost limits.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. Before 1995, four out of 10 people in Taiwan didn\u2019t have any medical insurance. For all its export-powered boom in the preceding decades, the capitalist society's score in treating preventable deaths was worse than countries behind the Iron Curtain. Now, Taiwan is doing almost as well as the U.S. on this measure, and isn\u2019t too too far behind Japan.\n\nTaiwan\u2019s transformation was triggered by its decision \u2014 on the recommendation of Princeton University economist Uwe Reinhardt \u2014 to move to a single-payer system. Effective insurance didn\u2019t come with a massive price tag. Taipei used technology, such as electronic health cards that store patient and treatment data, to drive efficiencies and limit spending to 6% of gross domestic product. That\u2019s far lower than other rich countries. The Taiwanese system isn\u2019t immune to cost pressures, but that\u2019s a price of its popularity: Some patients seek just too many consultations.\n\nIn India, public health expenditure is just 1.2% of GDP. Yet targeting a higher number won't automatically make things better. The right care, as Reinhardt emphasized, is about not pricing anyone out. But in India\u2019s heavily informal economy, only 90 million people earn regular salaries. Among them, 80% make less than $270 a month. Can this narrow base of taxpayers prop up a good standard of care at prices that don\u2019t exclude the poor?\n\nThe best means toward that end is making the government a single buyer of everything \u2014 from generic drugs (in which India is a world leader) to medical equipment \u2014 to prune expenditure. The country\u2019s natural wage advantage can be harnessed in providing labor-intensive services cheaply \u2014 not by impoverishing medical professionals but by stepping up hiring in the public sector and expanding state-funded training.\n\nAssume that superior cost management crunches the 2.4% of GDP that Indians spend out of pocket to 2%. Provide an equal amount for infrastructure investment for at least 10 years and throw in 1.2% of GDP of current public spending. The 5.2% of GDP in required funding can come, like in Taiwan, from payroll and sin taxes, as well as levies on interest, dividends and rents.\n\nThe financing will get centralized, not the service delivery. Private hospitals won\u2019t wither away, but they will have to accept government-mandated prices. The primary responsibility for clinical care will reside with India\u2019s 28 states. They will be free to offer add-ons. Maybe the national program won\u2019t be able to immediately cover chronic mental illness, for example. But richer western and southern states ought to be able to include it. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, the recently elected chief minister announced that his government will reimburse private hospitals\u2019 Covid-19 treatment bills. Additionally, private insurance plans will exist as a top-up for those who want specialized procedures or long-term rehabilitation.\n\nThe pandemic will eventually recede, but scarred citizens won\u2019t want to face such despair again. People are scrambling for resources on social media and elsewhere. Individuals have turned to importing oxygen concentrators, cutting deals with suppliers across the globe. Anecdotally, some are combining more widely available smaller-capacity breathing devices to create larger ones that are in short supply. Indian style jugaad, or quick, self-administered workarounds, can\u2019t fix a broken system, though. It\u2019s time to build health care anew.\n\nAnjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

Reuters was not able to independently establish the identities of those responsible for the incident.\n\nColonel Stephane Spet, a spokesman for the French air force, said an internal inquiry had been ordered by air force command and those responsible had been punished.\n\nThe most severe punishment was restriction to barracks, Spet said. He did not say how many people had received this punishment, or for how many days.\n\nSpet said that the pilot's safety was never in danger.\n\nThe pilot said in the complaint, which was seen by Reuters, that the hazing occurred in March 2019, soon after he arrived at a combat fighter unit at the Solenzara air base on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.\n\nThe pilot had a hood put over his head, and was forced into the back of a pick-up truck by several colleagues who drove him to the firing range, according to the complaint.\n\nPhotos, which were included in the complaint, showed a man in military fatigues with his legs and hands bound, attached to the firing range target with heavy-duty nylon straps.\n\nVideo footage, which is cited in the complaint and was provided to Reuters by the pilot's lawyer, Frederic Berna, also showed combat jets making several low passes nearby.\n\nThe complaint alleges that, during some of these passes, the pilot tied to the target could hear the sound of live munitions being fired from the aircraft.\n\nSpet did not dispute the authenticity of the images, but he said they created the mistaken impression that the aircraft were directing fire at the pilot who was tied to the target.\n\nHe said that the firing the pilot heard was from aircraft that were on a training exercise at a different location, and that the closest any munition round came to him was about one kilometre (0.6 miles).\n\nBerna said his client did not want his name disclosed publicly because of privacy concerns. Reuters has seen the pilot's name in the complaint.\n\nBerna said the photos and video footage cited in the complaint were filmed by service members who were present, and the images later shared in a WhatsApp group chat. Members of the group chat then shared the images with the pilot filing the complaint, the lawyer said.\n\nAsked why his client waited until now to file the complaint, Berna said the pilot had initially been in denial about the gravity of what he experienced, and did not want to challenge the military authorities.\n\nHe raised the issue with his superiors at the end of 2020, the lawyer said, and decided to file the criminal complaint when he felt the military was not responding adequately.\n\nSpet said the air force command was informed of the incident in January this year, and ordered an internal inquiry.\n\n\"The pilots responsible for staging this were severely punished in April 2021, with measures that went as far as restriction to barracks,\" Spet said.\n\nBerna said neither he nor his client had any knowledge of any punishment imposed on service personnel over the incident.\n\nIn a separate statement, the air force said it condemned any actions that harm the physical or mental wellbeing of its personnel, and that it would cooperate with any criminal investigation.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Solenzara base referred Reuters to the air force statement.\n\nThe complaint was filed with the state prosecutor's office in the city of Marseille on May 5, according to Berna. The lawyer said his client is still in the air force and serving as a pilot but is no longer a combat pilot.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The rupee rose 0.8% last week to 73.51 per dollar.\n\nGoh forecasts the rupee to fall to 76 per dollar in the second quarter but expects further declines to be limited by a reduction in imports.\n\nIndia\u2019s capital extended its lockdown for another week while the nation reported 403,736 new virus cases on Sunday, and more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths for a second day. Modi\u2019s political allies, top business leaders and even U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser have said lockdowns could be the only way to stem the world\u2019s worst virus outbreak.\n\nAnalysts have already trimmed India\u2019s growth forecasts as individual states tightened restrictions, but a nationwide curb could deal a much larger blow to the economy. The Reserve Bank of India stepped in last week to provide loan relief and pledged to inject 500 billion rupees ($6.8 billion) of liquidity to support growth.\n\nInflation data on Wednesday is expected to provide more economic cues. Consumer prices are forecast to have climbed 4.1% in April from a year earlier, the slowest pace since January, to stay within the RBI\u2019s 2%-6% target range, which would provide room for more support measures. However, signs of more quantitative easing would be bad news for the rupee.\n\nThe currency could remain supported as expectations of a surge in IPOs this year keeps inflows coming, although its near-term trend points to a downside as virus cases show no sign of slowing.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "The health ministers of Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra say no ventilator or oxygen concentrator donated by foreign countries have been delivered yet to their states, and that the Centre isn\u2019t telling them if they will get any of the aid.\n\nThe two states are among the worst hit by the second wave of covid.\n\nChhattisgarh health minister T.S. Singh Deo told Mint on Sunday that he has not been told anything about distribution of oxygen plants and ventilators they had sought. \u201cI had enquired last evening but till then nothing had come... We have no intimation. Maybe All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in (Raipur) Chhattisgarh may have got something, but nothing has come to us. We had asked for 280 ventilators and non-invasive ventilators, nasal cannula, oxygen plants and vaccines. Maybe if something was coming in the aid, they could be included,\" Deo said.\n\nSo far, the Centre had not shared \u201canything substantial\" with the Chhattisgarh government from the foreign aid it has received, he said. The worst-hit state, Maharashtra, has received only about 53,000 vials of remdesivir, but none of the other foreign aid it had requested.\n\nMaharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said his government had written letters to the Centre asking for substantial aid in view of the surge in covid-19 cases. \u201cWe are hopeful that if such a large amount of aid has been coming in, it is the right of the state to get the assistance. I hope the Centre will not ignore us, and we will get the required aid which we have been demanding for a long time,\" he added.\n\nMaharashtra has more than 628,000 active cases and reports around 800-900 deaths daily. \u201cWe will get at least 1 lakh remdesivir vials from about 13 suppliers from various countries that responded to global tenders,\" Tope said.\n\nIndia has received 6,738 oxygen concentrators, 3,856 oxygen cylinders, 16 oxygen generation plants, 4,668 ventilators, BiPAP and C-PAP machines and over 300,000 vials of remdesivir, which, the health ministry said, has been dispatched or delivered to various states.\n\nAnother 2,404 oxygen concentrators, 25,000 remdesivir vials, 218 ventilators and nearly 700,000 testing kits were received by India on Sunday.\n\nRecent data and tweets by the Union health ministry show that most of the oxygen concentrators have gone to central government hospitals.\n\nQueries sent to the spokesperson of the ministry, seeking an updated list of hospitals that have received the aid so far, did not elicit replies.\n\nThe health ministry on Sunday quoted comments from senior officials of AIIMS in New Delhi, Bhopal, Patna, Raipur, Raebareli and Bibinagar in Telangana about delivery of foreign aid.\n\nNITI Aayog chief executive officer Amitabh Kant denied the allegations, saying that \u201ceverything is moving on the field\". \u201cThis is all false, all lies. We are distributing the assistance in a transparent manner as soon as it arrives, with no delays. There is a well-laid-out procedure for this. The channels are smooth,\" said Kant.\n\n\u201cWe are getting requests from districts for a wide range of things\u2014digital thermometers, oxygen concentrators and cylinders, BiPAP machines, masks, PPE kits, disinfectants. I am getting demands from state officials and district hospitals. Whatever assistance is coming is not enough,\" an official from an NGO said, on condition of anonymity. The official works directly with the state disaster management authorities in Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.\n\nleroy.d@livemint.com\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.\n\nNever miss a story!

Exemption to vaccine from GST would be counterproductive without benefiting the consumer,\" a tweet by Thakur said.\n\nHe also said the government has provided full exemption from Customs duties, including integrated GST, is already available to all COVID relief material imported by the Indian Red Cross Society for free distribution in the country to help contain the spread.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

On Saturday, Kangana shared a tone-deaf post in which she not only announced that she has been infected with the virus but also wrote dismissively of it as a \"small time flu which got too much press.\" She was strongly criticized in the comments thread for her insensitivity and for spreading misinformation - India is battling a brutal second COVID wave with over 4,000 deaths a day, compounded by a severe shortage of oxygen and other medical resources.\n\nKangana Ranaut's typically unrepentant Instagram story claims Instagram deleted her post because she \"threatened to demolish COVID\"; she also takes a jibe at what she calls a \"COVID fan club.\"\n\nLast week, Twitter took away the actress' megaphone; her Instagram and Facebook accounts are still active but, as she notes in her Instagram story, perhaps not for much longer - \"don't think will last here for more than a week,\" she wrote.\n\nSee Kangana Ranaut's story here:\n\nKangana Ranaut joined social media only last year, taking over the official accounts managed by her team to tweet and post personally in August 2020.

    "Text": "People sit outside Pune railway station during lockdown restrictions imposed by the state government.\n\nAfter dipping into his savings to weather India's snap pandemic lockdown last March, Manoj Kumar was just getting his head above water again earning 600 rupees ($8) a day as a construction worker in the tourist hotspot of Goa.\n\nHe'd squirreled away enough for a trip last month to his native village in Bihar some 1,490 miles away for a wedding. He's still there, stuck in one of the nation's least developed states, as a fierce second Covid-19 wave triggers the world's worst health crisis and prevents his return. On a lucky day, he'll land some odd jobs that fetch him as much as 300 rupees. But there aren't too many of those chores left. So he's taking loans to feed and clothe his wife and three kids.\n\n\"It is all in God's hands now,\" said Kumar, who's told his wife to curtail spending on items such as lentils, cooking oil and clothes. \"I don't know when I will return. My family is worried and doesn't want me to go back as the cases are also rising in Goa.\"\n\nKumar, 40, is one of the millions of migrant workers who form part of India's vast unreported informal sector, which accounts for half of its $2.9 trillion, domestic demand-driven economy. A protracted Covid wave is shrinking incomes and wiping out savings of people like Kumar, posing the risk of a double whammy for Asia's third-largest economy that's still struggling to recover from last year's pandemic-induced recession.\n\nThe government estimates India's gross domestic product shrank 8% in the year ended March, its biggest contraction since 1952. Many economists are cutting their forecasts for the current fiscal year as rising unemployment and dwindling savings dim the chances of a double-digit growth. Shaun Roache, chief economist for Asia Pacific at S&P Global Ratings, slashed his prediction to 9.8% from 11% earlier. Fitch Solutions sees the economy expanding by 9.5%, a projection that's below the Bloomberg consensus of around 11%.\n\n\"A drawn-out Covid-19 outbreak will impede India's economic recovery,\" Singapore-based Roache said. \"The country already faces a permanent loss of output versus its pre-pandemic path, suggesting a long-term production deficit equivalent to about 10% of GDP.\"\n\nWith the latest surge caused by a new coronavirus strain, total infections in India have risen to 21.89 million, a third of which were added just in the past three weeks alone. Daily death count hit a record at 4,187 on Saturday. Experts have warned the crisis has the potential to worsen in the coming weeks, with one model predicting as many as 1,018,879 deaths by the end of July, quadrupling from the current official count of 238,270.\n\nHarsh and Sudden\n\nAs new travel restrictions are put in place in some of the nation's biggest economic centers to contain the outbreak, India's poor are likely to bear the brunt again, just as they did in 2020. They have yet to recover from the lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in late March last year. The harsh and sudden measure sparked an exodus of migrant workers from cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi, as they trekked hundreds of miles to reach home.\n\nPeople like Kumar typically work without contracts and often for a pittance. The so-called informal economy in India employs approximately 411 million workers, according to calculations by Jeemol Unni, a professor of economics at Ahmedabad University, who relied on surveys by the government's National Statistical Office to arrive at the number. While the low-paying farm sector employs the bulk of them, construction comes second with about 56 million.\n\nUnprotected by unions and politicians, these laborers often miss out on handouts from governments. After meeting daily expenses, they are left with little to pay for health care and medicines -- a risky situation especially when a pathogen is taking lives and sending thousands to intensive care at overcrowded hospitals running short of beds.\n\nDip in Savings\n\nEconomists warn depleting household savings and falling incomes will have an impact on domestic consumption, which accounts for almost 60% of GDP. A study by Nikhil Gupta, an economist at Mumbai-based brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd., found that India's household savings dropped to 22.1% of GDP in the quarter through December, from 28.1% in the three months ended June last year. Full-year numbers show India's savings growth lagged behind the likes of the U.S., the U.K. and Japan, he said.\n\n\"A slower rise in household savings, coupled with similar or slower decline in consumption, confirms weak income growth in India,\" Gupta said. \"If so, the contribution of pent-up demand in growth recovery would also be limited in India compared with other nations.\"\n\nData showed April jobless rate increased to nearly 8% from 6.5% in March, with more than seven million exiting the workforce last month, according to data from Center for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt., a private research firm.\n\nAs a result of all the turmoil that started last year, income inequality is deepening in India. A study by Pew Research Center has shown an estimated 75 million people slipped into poverty since the pandemic began. The second wave is set to crush some more. For the study, Pew considered daily incomes of 150 rupees or less as poor, 151 to 750 rupees as low income and 3,750 rupees and above as high income.\n\nA study by the Azim Premji University in Bangalore showed even more alarming numbers. About 230 million individuals slid below the national daily minimum wage threshold of 375 rupees during the pandemic, it said.\n\nThough India could still emerge as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it will also be one of the most unequal countries, Oxfam, a non-profit organization said.\n\nStephen Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone Group Inc., said in an interview last month that he's \"confident\" of the long-term prospects of India. The private-equity firm, which has plowed billions of dollars into the country and owns many of the nation's big office towers, said it would be accelerating its activities in the country. \"We will be investing more in the next 10 years than we have invested in the previous period,\" he said.\n\nDuvvuri Subbarao, a former governor of India's central bank, said the strife faced by the informal-economy workers could hurt India's long-term growth prospects. \"Inequalities have intensified because the formal sector has nearly normalized while the informal sector remains distressed,\" he said.\n\nSlower growth would be bad news for workers like A.K. Singh, who was a cook for a monthly salary of about 20,000 rupees in a restaurant in Mumbai. He fled recently to his home town of Gorakhpur in northern India to start a tire business, for which he's waiting for a loan.\n\n\"I used some of my savings and money I received from my last salary,\" he said. \"But there's a lockdown here too for the past week. My shop was hardly open for two days during the week. What will we earn out of that?",

    "Text": "Tina Ambani with her sons in a picture shared on the occasion of Mother's Day.\n\nAs people across the world celebrated Mother's Day yesterday, social media was flooded with the sweetest posts. Several celebrities and noted personalities also took to social media to express their gratitude to mothers and mother figures in their life. From billionaire entrepreneurs like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos to Bollywood stars like Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra, several celebs shared Mother's Day tributes on Instagram. Take a look:\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg shared a picture of wife Priscilla Chan and their two daughters on Mother's Day. The picture shows Priscilla being kissed by the two girls as she smiles for the camera. \"Happy Mother's Day to Priscilla, to my wonderful mom, and to all the moms out there!\" Mark Zuckerberg captioned the picture.\n\nAmazon's Jeff Bezos took a trip down memory lane on Sunday. He shared a throwback photo of himself and his siblings with their mother, Jacklyn Bezos, next to a more recent one of the family together. \"To a mom who always had her hands full. Thank you for absolutely everything. We love you, Mom!\" wrote Jeff Bezos.\n\nMelinda Gates also shared a Mother's Day post on Sunday - a few days after she and her husband, Bill Gates, announced they were splitting up. Melinda Gates shared a picture with their three children and wrote: \"I love being their mother. To anyone celebrating a mom or a mother figure, honoring a memory of someone you loved, or reflecting on your own resilience today, I hope your day is a meaningful one.\"\n\nTesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk did not share a Mother's Day tribute on social media - he did one better. Elon Musk invited his mother Maye Musk to join him as he hosted 'Saturday Night Live' - and promised her a dogecoin as a Mother's Day gift. Maye Musk later shared a pic from their SNL appearance on Instagram and wrote: \"Happy Mother's Day to mothers all over the world.\n\nStill smiling from the fun time I had on stage with Elon.\"\n\nCloser home, Tina Ambani shared a Mother's Day post for her mother-in-law as well as her mother. \"The warmest place in the world is a mother's embrace; a source of incredible comfort and the purest, most elemental love,\" she wrote, sharing three pictures on Instagram. The first one shows her with her sons, Anmol and Anshul, and the other two feature her mother and her mother-in-law, Kokilaben Ambani. \"Gratitude and love to my two mothers today - and every day,\" said Tina Ambani.\n\nMeanwhile, Priyanka Chopra's Mother's Day post came with a hilarious quote.\n\n\"I do what I want, where I want, when I want.... if my mom says it's ok,\" the actress wrote. She shared a picture of mom Madhu Chopra alongside a picture of her mother-in-law Denise Jonas and added: \"I'm so blessed to look up to two incredible women who lead by example everyday. Love you.\"\n\n\n\nClick for more trending news",

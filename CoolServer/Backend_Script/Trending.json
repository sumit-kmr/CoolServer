    "Text": "Reservation beyond 50% will create a society \u201cbased on caste rule\", the Supreme Court held on Wednesday as it quashed a 2018 Maharashtra law for reservation to Marathas in jobs and educational institutions, while also refusing to consider scrapping of the 50% ceiling.\n\nThe SC also dealt a severe blow to the authority of state governments in identifying backward classes by ruling that after the 2018 amendment in the Constitution, only the central government could notify socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs).\n\nThe interpretation of the 102nd constitutional amendment may impinge severely on the power of states to provide reservation benefits after separately identifying backward classes.\n\nThe judgment was delivered on a clutch of petitions on the validity of the Maratha quota law, which had breached the 50% limit for reservations.\n\nThe bench, comprising justices Ashok Bhushan, L. Nageswara Rao, S. Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S. Ravindra Bhat, was unanimous in declaring the Maratha quota law \u201cunsustainable\" and in affirming that the 50% ceiling on the total reservation was inviolable.\n\nHowever, the ruling on depriving states of the power to identify SEBCs was on a majority of 3-2, with justices Bhushan and Nazeer saying that states could still have their own list of SEBCs.\n\nThe bench underlined that the 50% upper limit as fixed by a nine-judge bench in the Indra Sawhney case (known as the Mandal Commission case) in 1992 follows principles of reasonability and equality and unanimously said \u201cto change the 50% limit is to have a society which is not founded on equality but based on caste rule\".\n\n\u201cIf the reservation goes above the 50% limit, which is reasonable, it will be a slippery slope. The cap is to achieve the principle of equality and with the object to strike a balance which cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable,\" asserted the court.\n\nIt rejected a plea made jointly by several states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh that opposed any upper limit on the reservation and sought a reconsideration of the 1992 verdict to enable them to extend the quota beyond 50% in view of the change in times.\n\n\u201cThere can be no quarrel that society changes, law changes, people change. But that does not mean that something which is good and proven to be beneficial in maintaining equality in the society should also be changed in the name of change alone,\" said the bench, rejecting the requests by the state governments to refer the case to a larger bench for reviewing the 1992 verdict.\n\nThe SC highlighted that India has been independent for 73 years, during which quota benefits were granted as affirmative measures to bring equality in the society and maintained that reservation in public services was not the only means and method for improving the welfare of backward classes.\n\n\u201cThe state ought to bring other measures, including providing educational facilities to the members of the backward class free of cost, giving concession in fee, providing opportunities for skill development to enable the candidates from the backward class to be self-reliant,\" it told the states.\n\nAbout the 2018 law for reservation to Marathas, the apex court bench lamented that the state government opted to give reservation to a class that was \u201csocially dominant\", \u201cpolitically dominant\" and \u201cin the mainstream of national life\" and, thus, there was no justification to breach the 50% ceiling for a class that also had adequate representation in public employment.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

As a result, petrol and diesel were retailing at Rs90.99 per litre and Rs81.42 per litre respectively on Thursday in Delhi at state run Indian Oil Corporation Ltd\u2019s outlets.\n\nThis comes against the backdrop of a second wave of covid-19 pandemic raging across India, a major energy consumer.\n\n\u201cFirmer fundamentals are expected beginning in May with sequential demand increases. Oil supply growth is expected to lag demand growth with ongoing Opec restraint (on 27 April, Opec+ decided to maintain its production plan from 1 April).

Following the covid outbreak, crude prices for Indian basket of crude had plunged to $19.90 in April last year before recovering to $63.40 a barrel in April, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell showed.\n\nInterestingly, the diesel and petrol retail prices in India have remained subdued during the elections, with three government-run oil marketing companies\u2014Indian Oil Corp.

Ltd (HPCL)\u2014refraining from raising prices.\n\nThe state-run OMCs and the government have maintained that there is no correlation between elections and transportation fuel price freeze. The government\u2019s stand has been that it has got no role in pricing since India\u2019s three government-run OMCs introduced dynamic fuel pricing, joining countries such as the US and Australia, where fuel prices change daily depending on global oil price fluctuations.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "With COVID-19 vaccine demand declining in the United States, some Canadians facing third-wave lockdowns are flying south to get inoculated, perhaps months earlier than they would be able to at home.\n\nJimmy Simmons, 37, saw friends in their 40s struggling to get a shot in the hard-hit Canadian province of Ontario. The Toronto businessman decided to spend a few weeks in New York City to meet clients and get vaccinated. He got his first of two shots on Tuesday.\n\nSimmons, who works in real estate, is not yet eligible for a vaccine in Ontario. His girlfriend, a medical student who treats COVID-19 patients at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, has still only received one dose, he said.\n\n\"I want this (pandemic) to end, and in order for this end I need to get vaccinated,\" Simmons said. \"Just sitting at home in Ontario isn't going to change anything.\"\n\nWhile almost a third of Americans have been fully vaccinated, Canada has inoculated only 3% of its almost 38 million people, though more than 34% have received a first dose.\n\nCanada is allowing for a four-month gap between doses, while Americans are getting their second shots three or four weeks after the first to reach optimal protection much sooner.\n\nThe U.S vaccination campaign has reached a tipping point, with supply outstripping demand due to a combination of factors including skepticism about the vaccines. The number of Americans seeking vaccines dropped by a third in recent weeks, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThat is encouraging Canadians to cross the border and tap into this oversupply without paying any fee, which means the U.S. government is paying for foreign travelers to get their COVID-19 shots. The White House declined to comment.\n\nSimmons and others had little trouble getting vaccinated at no charge in the United States, where the government is now practically begging people to get the shots and several states do not require proof of residency.\n\nThe trick was to fly because land crossing has been closed to non-essential traffic since March of 2020.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged those who are hesitant to get a COVID-19 vaccine, saying it was a matter of \"life or death.\"\n\nEveryone age 16 or older can get vaccinated in the United States, while in Ontario, most adults 18 and up will not be eligible for a first dose until May 24.\n\n'REALLY EASY'\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said everyone who wants to can be fully vaccinated by the end of September. Andrew D'Amours, 31, of Quebec City, said that could mean \"another half pandemic\" without getting inoculated.\n\nHe flew to Dallas and got vaccinated on April 10. With his business partner at the Flytrippers https://flytrippers.com travel website, D'Amours booked an appointment for the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine online.\n\n\"It took a couple clicks. We got an appointment in a grocery store pharmacy and we booked flights for the next day, Friday, and on Saturday morning we were vaccinated,\" D'Amours said.\n\nWhile D'Amours used hotel and flight points, he estimated a weekend trip to Dallas - if two people share costs - could be as low as C$750 ($611) each. He flew directly from Montreal.\n\nDavid, 37, an executive from Ontario, said he and his girlfriend got vaccinated without appointments at the Ellis Davis Field House site in Dallas, after showing a Texas hotel address.\n\nWhen the couple went back for their second shot, \"there was no one there,\" he said. \"It's immoral that they may be throwing shots out while people are dying of COVID,\" he said.\n\nAmericans have been sharing vaccines with Canadians in other ways. Truck drivers from Manitoba and Saskatchewan are receiving jabs in North Dakota, while Alaska's governor has offered surplus shots to a neighboring Canadian town to help reopen the border sooner.\n\nWhile it is not known how many Canadians are traveling for U.S. vaccines, several people on Simmons' packed flight to New York told him they would get inoculated, and D'Amours has fielded several queries from others interested in doing so.\n\nCanada still discourages foreign travel and requires a 14-day quarantine and testing upon re-entry. D'Amours said it still may be worth it.\n\n\"If you want to travel, if you want to be fully vaccinated, and you're able to go and you're going to do it safely, it is really easy,\" he said.\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

    "Text": "As the virus mutates further, a third wave of Covid infection is inevitable and it is necessary to be prepared for new waves, the government's Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan cautioned on Wednesday.\n\nWith active cases climbing to 34.87 lakh in India, the top scientific officer said it was not expected that the second wave would hit the country with such ferocity.\n\n\"Phase three is inevitable given the higher levels of circulating virus, but it is not clear on what time-scale this phase three will occur. We should be prepared for new waves,\" he said.\n\nVijayRaghavan said although vaccines are efficacious against new mutations like the UK one and the double mutant, surveillance and vaccine updates are needed as the virus mutates further.\n\nThe virus has now adopted a \u201chit and run lifestyle\". Also, a combination of less cautionary measures and low immunity in the population from the first wave is driving the second wave, which has killed thousands and infected lakhs of people across the country.\n\nMany factors contributed to this second wave and variants are one of the factors, he said.\n\nThe first wave peaked in September last year and cases started falling substantially. The first wave declined because of two factors, he said.\n\n\"As infections rose, so did immunity among those infected. A combination of the standing level of immunity in the population and cautionary steps halted the spread of the first wave,\" he said.\n\nBut as the cautionary steps declined, new opportunities for infection arose and the level of immunity among the population is often not enough to stop the infection spread.\n\n\"Many people get infected until they reach a new immunity threshold. Such a second wave is typically smaller than the first. Such a second wave was expected. However, multiple parameters can change and add up to the second wave, much larger than the first.\n\n\"(But) Such a larger second wave with the ferocity we are seeing was not predicted,\" he said.\n\nA study conducted by the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) suggested that the recurrence of the coronavirus outbreak in March could have been due to the lack of \"meaningful antibodies\" in seropositive people after a peak in September last year.\n\nElaborating on the evolution of SARS-CoV2 and its increasing lethality, VijayRaghavan said the virus emerged in 2019 in Wuhan and at that time it was a generalist that could infect many mammal species.\n\nThe first phase saw two mutations every month, he said.\n\nHowever, the second phase which started in October 2020 saw dramatic changes and new variants like the UK variant coming to the fore.\n\n\"In early 2021, a very large number of people all over the world had been infected. As the immunity increases, the virus does not have the opportunity to grow,\" he said.\n\n\"But it sees that there are pockets it can go through and therefore it evolves for better transmission,\" he added\n\nEarlier, the virus-infected people were largely asymptomatic and many symptomatic and it had a certain profile of progression.\n\n\u201cNow it has adopted, due to fewer people available, a hit and run lifestyle. And this is what is happening with the new variants coming,\" he said.\n\nVijayRaghavan said that distancing can exponentially bring down the spread.\n\n\"The virus can only go from human to human,\" he said, stressing on following Covid- appropriate behaviour.\n\nDuring the briefing, Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary in the Health Ministry, said 12 states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, have more than one lakh active Covid cases.\n\nKarnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Bihar are among the states that show an increasing trend in daily cases, he said.\n\nAgarwal added that 24 states and UTs have more than 15 percent Covid positivity rate. Thirty districts are showing a continued rise in coronavirus cases since the last two weeks of which 10 are in Kerala, seven in Andhra Pradesh, three in Karnataka and one in Tamil Nadu, he added.\n\nA record 3,780 fresh Covid-19 fatalities were registered in a single day in India taking the death toll to 2,26,188, while 3,82,315 new coronavirus infections were recorded, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday.\n\nWith the fresh cases, the total tally of Covid-19 cases in the country climbed to 2,06,65,148.\n\nRegistering a steady increase, the active cases have increased to 34,87,229 comprising 16.87 per cent of the total infections, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate was recorded at 82.03 per cent, the data updated at 8 am showed.\n\nVK Paul, Member (Health) NITI Aayog, appealed to the \"physicians' fraternity'' to come forward and provide teleconsultations to people and families at home who are infected with the coronavirus.\n\n\"The response to the changing virus remains the same. We need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour such as masking, distancing, hygiene, no unnecessary meetings and staying at home,\" he said.\n\nHe said personal behaviour (masks, distancing and hygiene), vaccination and tracking, and containment are three pillars that stop the chain of virus transmission.\n\n\u201cThey are the same for the Wuhan virus and they are the same for the B.1.1.7 or B.1.617,\" Paul said.\n\nIn a reply to a question, Paul said the disease is not spreading through animals and it's human to human transmission.\n\nOn vaccination, Agarwal said the total doses administered till now was 16.05 crore.\n\nWhile 12.31 crore people above the age of 45 years have been vaccinated, the number is at 1.58 crore among healthcare workers.\n\nAround 2.09 crore frontline workers have also been vaccinated, while 6.71 lakh people between 18 years to 44 years have got their jabs so far, he added.\n\nIn response to another question, Agarwal said that foreign aid is being monitored by a group of senior officials.\n\n\"Our technical wing has made guidelines to see what hospital the equipment would be suitable for.

    "Text": "Describing the situation in the national capital as \u201creally critical\", the Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the central government to ensure that Delhi receives 700 tonnes of medical oxygen supplies every day and asked for a detailed plan on how it intends to do so.\n\nThe bench of justices Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud and M.R. Shah also stayed the contempt proceedings initiated by the Delhi high court against the Centre on Tuesday over the shortage in oxygen supply. But the apex court clarified that it is conditioned on the Union government\u2019s admission that the court order of 2 May required the Centre to supply 700 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi until further orders.\n\nIntroducing a personal element to the hearing, the court said even judges feel \u201chelpless\" as people plead for help due to the shortage of oxygen, hospital beds and essential medicines in the national capital.\n\n\u201cWe are not only judges but also citizens of this country. Justice Shah and I have been continuously on the phone trying to come up with some solution by using our good offices. But we are also helpless. So, we can understand what a common man and citizens feel. We are ultimately answerable to the people,\" the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre.\n\nThe court shot down a suggestion by Mehta to not insist on 700 tonnes for Delhi while the Centre tries to supply as much as possible.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t accept this as an institutional response. The situation of Delhi is really critical. We are answerable to the citizens, and we know with 550 tonnes (the amount that reached Delhi on Tuesday) what is happening on the ground. Our friendships are limited because of our positions, but our offices are getting numerous calls, and the lawyers and others are crying. They plead, \u2018please do something\u2019. When 550 tonnes is not solving the problem of Delhi, we cannot review our orders... there is tremendous anxiety on the part of the citizens to run from pillar to post for oxygen and cylinders,\" the court told Mehta.\n\nMehta, on his part, pressed for an audit to figure out Delhi\u2019s real requirement and optimal utilization of medical oxygen before determining the final number. The bench accepted the suggestion for an audit and asked the Centre and Delhi government to suggest some names by Thursday morning for a panel that would examine this. But it made it clear that the 2 May order for 700 tonnes shall remain in force unless it is modified.\n\nThe oxygen crisis in the Capital has been ascribed to a lower allocation by the Centre despite demands from the Delhi government for an increased oxygen quota and the Delhi government\u2019s failure to arrange for cryogenic tankers and trucks to transport the allocated oxygen.\n\n\u201cNobody can dispute it is a national disaster. Nobody can dispute there is a deficit of oxygen. Nobody can dispute some people have lost lives due to a shortage of oxygen. So, now let us ensure lives are saved. We want you to ensure 700 tonnes is given between today and Monday (when the special bench takes up the matter initiated on its own) so that it takes the sting off the immediate humanitarian crisis in Delhi,\" it said.\n\nThe bench asked Mehta to submit a tabulated statement by 10.30am on Thursday, indicating the manner in which its order is complied with and the details on sources of supply, transportation and other logistical arrangements. \u201cThis plan will remain in operation till further orders of the court,\" it ordered.\n\nAbout the contempt proceedings initiated by the Delhi high court on Tuesday, the bench expressed displeasure with the Centre\u2019s law officers trying to misinterpret the Supreme Court\u2019s order on 700 tonnes to wriggle out of the liability.\n\n\u201cWhy did your additional solicitors general (ASG) tell the high court we didn\u2019t order for 700 tonnes? The problem is when your law officers argue like this, and then you get into a crossfire. Tell your ASGs not to misinterpret orders...Hauling up anyone in contempt will not get anybody oxygen in the country. We want the oxygen to come,\" it told Mehta.\n\nThe court also asked the officials of the Centre and Delhi government to have a meeting on Wednesday evening for deliberation on the supply and distribution of oxygen and examine the \u201cMumbai model\" of optimal utilization of oxygen.\n\nThe solicitor general cited the \u201cMumbai model\", pointing out that despite having a caseload of 92,000 as of 10 April, Mumbai made do with just 275 tonnes of oxygen. The city also made arrangements for buffer storage for imminent requirements. The court said that the Delhi government should consider replicating this model for the national capital.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

More than 1,60,000 MBBS doctors last year had taken the exam, seeking admission to various MD (Doctor of Medicine), MS (Master's in Surgery) and PG Diploma courses.\n\nThe government also decided to allow the deployment of Medical Interns in Covid Management duties under the supervision of their faculty, as part of the Internship rotation.\n\n\"The individuals providing services in Covid management will be given priority in forthcoming regular Government recruitments after they complete minimum of 100 days of Covid duty,\" the central government said.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

These are the real challenges we face that this empty promise ignores,\" Ubl said.\n\n\u201cIn the past few days alone, we\u2019ve seen more American vaccine exports, increased production targets from manufacturers, new commitments to COVAX and unprecedented aid for India during its devastating Covid-19 surge,\" he said.\n\n\u201cBiopharmaceutical manufacturers are fully committed to providing global access to Covid-19 vaccines, and they are collaborating at a scale that was previously unimaginable, including more than 200 manufacturing and other partnerships to date.\n\nThe biopharmaceutical industry shares the goal to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible, and we hope we can all re-focus on that shared objective,\" he added.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Republican leader Kevin Brady said that the world needs Covid vaccines now, but it shouldn\u2019t be done by damaging the pathway to new vaccines and cures the world will need in the future.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead to the next pandemic, it is dangerous for America to consent to strip away patents on lifesaving Covid vaccines now that cost businesses billions of dollars to develop at a historic pace - and to reward China with access to US innovation for a world pandemic China created,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe better solution to help our global neighbours is to solve the very real logistical hurdles slowing access to these vaccines, not undermine the incentives to develop them,\" Brady said.\n\nNurses in the US on the other hand applauded the decision.\n\n\u201cThe welcome statement by President Biden\u2019s US Trade Representative Katherine Tai joining this effort is a landmark decision that is also a tribute to healthcare and human rights activists, and nurses in particular, around the world who have been pressing for this humanitarian step,\" said National Nurses United (NNU) president Jean Ross.\n\n\u201cAs nurses on the front lines, we can tell you with absolute certainty: People are dying and will continue to die because of strict IP laws that are preventing the generic production of Covid-19 vaccines,\" said NNU executive director Bonnie Castillo.\n\n\u201cThere is no time to waste; we need to urgently scale up the manufacturing of vaccines, and to do that, the WTO must grant this waiver,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, KEI, a civil society organisation that is on the forefront of IP waiver demand, applauded the decision by Tai to \u201cactively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)\" for a waiver of intellectual property protections for Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nThis decision isolates the European Union and other countries that have been blocking the waiver, a media release said.\n\nThe Biden administration's decision will make it easier for the WTO's General Council to approve the proposal.\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

    "Text": "Anshu Thakur is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP\u2019s) IT cell, but the target of his latest Facebook outrage is the party itself. \u201cThis is no time for free food. Give us vaccines,\" he posted on Bihar BJP\u2019s Facebook page in response to a post announcing 5kg of free foodgrain in May and June for the beneficiaries of the public distribution system of the state\u2019s coalition government, where his party partners with Janata Dal (United).\n\nIn Jhanjharpur, a town in Mahbubani district where Thakur serves as a coordinator of the IT cell, he said \u201cevery second person is covid positive.\" He said health facilities are stretched, the member of Parliament has not been seen, and all people have is each other. Never before has he had a reason to question the party\u2019s course of action. \u201cToday, I have many questions. Questions for the government from the perspective of a common citizen. Questions for the party as a member. Questions for the leader as a supporter.\" As of today, Bihar has more than 100,000 active cases and 2,821 total deaths, but the dispatches from its remote corners hint at a manic spread of the virus.\n\nThakur said he is helping as many people as he can, but the resulting goodwill will no longer flow from the worker to the party: \u201cLog samajhdar hote ja rahe hain, madam (people are becoming smarter).\" He claimed that if the BJP did not come to its voters\u2019 rescue now, it would face the consequences in future elections. \u201cPeople put their trust in (Narendra) Modi ji last time (In Bihar). All of India went along with him. But if they are facing problems right now, naturally, they will go with the opposition the next time. There will be a 100% effect of this. It is already showing. You can even say the (West) Bengal election results showed that. You and I may not be facing problems, but it doesn\u2019t mean people aren\u2019t. Problem is there. Big problem is there.\"\n\nThakur\u2019s frustration resonates with a growing number of workers, voters and followers of the BJP, cutting a wide swathe through the party\u2019s support base. They include rural and urban residents, truck drivers and businessmen, first-time voters and lifelong supporters. Many of them have publicly blamed the party and the prime minister over the past few weeks as covid-19 threatens themselves and their families. To be sure, large numbers of BJP\u2019s followers remain staunchly loyal regardless of how the party is handling the pandemic, but its social media forums are buzzing with diehard supporters questioning the decisions to hold election rallies, export vaccines, and invite millions of people to gather at Kumbh Mela well into India\u2019s second wave. Some of them say similar discussions are taking place in the long queues at hospitals, pharmacies, oxygen vendors and crematoriums in the cities overtaken by the virus.\n\n\u201cOne of my colleague\u2019s mom died the other day. His token number said 80 at the crematorium. I have never seen tokens being handed out at a crematorium. I have only seen it at game parlours,\" said Sameer Mayank, a businessman from Lucknow who calls himself a \u201cblind follower\" of the BJP. \u201cWe are experiencing bizarre things here. My colleague got a token number for 80 while the city\u2019s daily death figures stand below 40. If you ask me, Lucknow\u2019s official numbers are 1/10th of the actual toll. Every second home in Lucknow according to me, has a covid patient. In 38 years of my life, I have never seen so many dead bodies.\" Mayank has been lashing out against the state government, which he accuses of delaying test results and denying hospital admissions: \u201cI am only showing my anger against Mr Yogi (Adityanath). He is doing nothing. At least PM Modi is getting in foreign aid.\" His anger is personal. \u201cMy wife got infected; my three-and-a-half-year-old daughter got infected; my in-laws got infected. We tested them on 17 April. Their antigen tests were positive. But their RT-PCR results are pending as of 1 May. We treated ourselves at home. According to the government, they still don\u2019t have covid. People are not getting beds, oxygen, even hospital admission, whether government or private, without RT-PCR results. If anyone died in my family, it would be a non-covid death.\"\n\nAs someone who has voted for BJP in every central and state election since he turned 18, Mayank says his expectations were much higher. \u201cIn this city, we are hardcore BJP supporters. Atal Bihari Vajpayee used to fight elections from here. Besides admiration for him, there is the caste factor. Pandits and Thakurs vote BJP only. The average voting time is 2-3 seconds over here. The first person comes out of the booth and tells everyone which number shows lotus. We don\u2019t care who the candidate is. If a dog stands on a BJP ticket, he will also win from here.\"\n\nHe said the same people are \u201cextremely frustrated\" with BJP\u2019s priorities. Even religion isn\u2019t working as glue. \u201cPeople are dying, and you are organizing Kumbh. Saints have died because of the congregation. I am a hardcore worshipper, but I can\u2019t support this decision. How many oxygen plants could they have installed with the money that is being spent to build Ram mandir in Ayodhya?\"\n\nThe party has a lot to lose if voters like him feel abandoned at this time, he argued.\n\n\u201cTo be very honest, only in this pandemic, the government is non-performing. Lucknow is a sea of BJP supporters, but a tsunami of dissatisfaction is sweeping through us. At the Centre, BJP will return but not in this state. As far as my vote is concerned, it will go to NOTA (None of The Above).\"\n\nSome of BJP\u2019s current critics were only drawn to the party because of PM Modi. Just months ago, they believed there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do for the nation; today, they doubt everything he says.\n\nAditya Choudhary, a 27-year-old unemployed man from Bihar\u2019s Sitamarhi, is one of them. \u201cBihar is in an awfully bad shape. Sitamarhi\u2019s official website is showing 2,000 cases. But I don\u2019t think there are 2,000 cases only. Test results are being delayed here. Those who are serious are not getting ICU beds or oxygen. They are bound to die, right? I get 200 calls every day. I connect people with local resources. But some people die before I can help them.\"\n\nChoudhary argues that Bihar\u2019s covid-19 crisis needs political intervention. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond the control of administrative officials. They are helpless because they don\u2019t have access to the resources they need.\" But he no longer trusts his chosen leader. \u201cBefore corona, I saw Modi ji in a different light. I saw him as a man who went abroad, met important people, raised India\u2019s stature in the world. But being a world leader is pointless if you can\u2019t stand up to the local needs. How can you send vaccine abroad when people are dying in your country? If you are not doing what the public chose you for, what is the point of making grand speeches?\"\n\nThis is the first time his political instincts are defined by the ground realities. \u201cThese are hard times for people. If they aren\u2019t sick, they are broke. What is he our Pradhan Sevak for? Modi ji\u2019s image has been vitiated. This calamity will affect the upcoming elections, whether the party acknowledges this or not.\"\n\nIf Choudhary ever steps into a polling booth again, he said it would be to vote for himself.\n\n\u201cI will make my own party and lead the country one day, whether it\u2019s today or tomorrow. Write it down.\"\n\nView Full Image Some of BJP\u2019s current critics were drawn to the party because of Modi.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India has a total of 20.6 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 226,000 deaths.\n\nCountries across the South Asia region are witnessing rises in infections, with India accounting for over 90 per cent of both cases and deaths in the region, according to the World Health Organisation.\n\nIndia also accounted for 46 per cent of global cases and 25 per cent of global deaths reported in the past week, WHO added.\n\nUNICEF Regional Director for South Asia George Laryea-Adjei said in a statement that urgent action and steadfast leadership are indispensable to stop the catastrophe.\n\n\u201cGovernments must do everything within their power to stop the devastation, and partners that can send assistance must do so immediately. The international community must step up without delay,\" Laryea-Adjei said.\n\n\u201cThis is not just a moral imperative. The deadly new surge in South Asia threatens us all. It has the potential to reverse hard-earned global gains against the pandemic if not halted as soon as possible,\" Laryea-Adjei added.\n\nUNICEF said the \u201cscenes we are witnessing in South Asia\" are unlike anything the region has seen before.\n\n\u201cFamily members of patients are pleading for help as the region reels under an acute shortage of medical-grade oxygen.

    "Text": "Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said the resurgence of the pandemic has adversely impacted the nascent recovery process in India, but maintained that the country will sail through the storm with the focus of the government on robust public health measures, timely treatment of infected persons, sound macro-economic management, and strong macro fundamentals.\n\nThe country is under the grip of the second wave and this has caused suffering for a large number of people and put a huge strain on the healthcare system, Sitharaman said at the virtual 54th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to the international community for their support in this hour of need. The vaccine production capacity in the country is being ramped up and more candidates are on verge of entering the commercial chain. We are confident that with expected access to critical raw materials, we would not only be able to meet our needs but also soon be back to meet critical vaccine needs of the world,\" she said.\n\nThe world is facing an unprecedented global crisis with the world economy contracting last year, threatening a severe development setback and hindering progress of developing member countries towards achieving 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, Sitharaman said. \u201cPoverty has been reduced over the years, but in 2020, an estimated 78 million people were pushed back into extreme poverty and inequality aggravated,\" the minister said.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Centre report released in March, the pandemic may have shrunk India\u2019s middle-class population by 32 million and driven 75 million below the poverty line in 2020, as a severe recession walloped Asia\u2019s third-largest economy. The World Bank has cautioned that the pandemic is pushing millions of Indians into poverty and eroding the hard-fought gains made in the past two decades.\n\nThe finance minister thanked ADB for rising to the occasion by delivering early and rapid support to the region, first through a comprehensive covid response programme to help counter the severe macroeconomic and health impact, and coming up with a vaccine support package.\n\nHowever, Sitharaman urged ADB to increase its capital base and lending to India. \u201cIndia has the absorptive capacity to receive about $4 billion a year from sovereign operations and about $1.5 billion annually from the private sector financing window. This should be viewed against the backdrop that on average in the last 5 years the net sovereign inflows, excluding CPRO (Covid-19 Pandemic Response Option) loan, into India have been less than $700 million and the net non-sovereign lending has been negative,\" she said.\n\nSitharaman also urged ADB to increase private sector financing with the debt burden on sovereigns rising. \u201cSuch financing would also help leverage the capital of ADB much better. However, the non-sovereign lending of ADB came down substantially in 2020 and is projected to stay at sub-2019 level at least for another six years. The ADB\u2019s Work Programme 2021-23 projects a reduction in non-sovereign commitments by $32 billion over 2020-35. While we welcome the strategy to increase sector and geographical diversification in private sector lending, this rather calls for more and not less absolute lending,\" she said.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "Now that US President Joe Biden has backed a proposed waiver for Covid-19 vaccine intellectual property rights, the next stop is for the World Trade Organization to hammer out a deal - a process that could take months.\n\nNot only are the negotiations expected to be lengthy, they are also likely to result in a waiver that is significantly narrower in scope and shorter in duration than the one initially proposed by India and South Africa, trade experts said.\n\nPrior to Biden's announcement, the two countries confirmed their intention to draft a new proposal at a WTO General Council meeting on Wednesday, prompting the body's new Director-General, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to express hope for \"a pragmatic solution.\"\n\nTen meetings in seven months have failed to move WTO members toward consensus on the original waiver proposal.\n\n\"At a minimum, it's going to be a month or two,\" Clete Willems, a former Trump White House trade official who previously worked at the US trade mission to the WTO in Geneva, said of any possible agreement.\n\n\"Right now, there is no proposal on the table that would waive the TRIPS agreement simply for vaccines,\" he said, referring to the WTO's agreement on 'Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights' that governs the transfer of property like movie rights or vaccine-manufacturing specifics.\n\nA more realistic goal may be completion of the agreement in time for the WTO's next ministerial conference, scheduled for Nov. 30 through Dec. 3, said Willems, now a trade partner at the Akin Gump law firm in Washington. That would give vaccine producers more time to boost global supplies which could help contain the virus and ease pressure for the waiver.\n\nThe initial IP waiver proposal by India and South Africa last October included vaccines, treatments, diagnostic kits, ventilators, protective gear and other products related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nHAGGLING OVER WORDS\n\nUS Trade Representative Katherine Tai said on Wednesday that she will pursue \"text-based negotiations\" on the WTO waiver, the standard but tedious process for trade deal talks. Negotiators trade texts with their preferred wording, then try to find common ground, sometimes leaving blank spaces for thorny differences to be settled by politicians.\n\nAll 164 WTO member countries must reach consent on such decisions, with any one member able to veto them, so there could be a lot of red pencils out. Negotiations are likely to be held in a mixture of virtual and in-person meetings.\n\n\"Those negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved,\" Tai said in a statement that tamped down expectations for a quick deal.\n\nUS companies, which strive to influence the USTR's trade negotiations, are already mobilizing to try to ensure the WTO talks lead to a waiver that's as narrowly targeted as possible.\n\n\"This is a mitigation effort. We're aiming to make it less bad than it otherwise would be,\" one industry source said.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are pushing the argument that the decision will hand American technology to China.\n\n\"What this decision will do, if it goes forward, is benefit countries like China that are aggressively trying to obtain US technology to bolster their own domestic champions,\" Republican Senator Mike Crapo said in a statement.\n\nWhile Biden's backing adds political impetus to get a deal done, other countries with big pharmaceuticals sectors, including Britain, Japan, Switzerland and in the European Union, were opposed to the waiver and have the ability to block a deal.\n\nOn the plus side, a successful waiver negotiation would \"improve the atmospherics\" at the WTO, which has been marked by failure to reach agreement on substantive new trade policy since its inception in 1995, said Harry Broadman, a former Clinton administration trade official who helped negotiate the trade body's creation.\n\n\"It's good that the WTO hopefully can actually think about a consensus,\" Broadman said, adding that he sees slim prospects that a vaccine deal could revive prospects for broader WTO negotiations.\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

Sujatha Rao, a former Union health secretary, also expressed the need for transparent data and a solution to the oxygen crisis. She said a nationwide lockdown like the one imposed in 2020 would only hurt the poor. Instead, only the districts reporting more than 100 daily cases could be subjected to a lockdown, while other districts of concern\u2014those with 50-100 daily cases\u2014could be targeted with stringent localized containment zones, she said.\n\nEven without a nationwide lockdown, public movement has shrunk below June 2020 levels in 11 major states. June 2020 was the last month of the nationwide lockdown last year. Relative to the pre-pandemic times, mobility is the lowest in Delhi (34%) followed by Chhattisgarh (39%). This has also begun to hit economic activity across India, high-frequency indicators have shown.\n\nIn the two weeks since Modi\u2019s address, India has reported 5 million new covid-19 infections and nearly 44,000 deaths.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

(File)\n\nCascade Investment, the holding company created by Bill Gates, transferred stock in two of Mexico's largest companies to Melinda French Gates, bringing the total amount she's received in the past few days to more than $2 billion.\n\nCascade moved stock in Coca-Cola FEMSA and Grupo Televisa to her control, according to regulatory filings dated May 3, the same day the Gateses announced they were ending their 27-year marriage. Cascade shifted about $1.8 billion of shares in Canadian National Railway Co. and AutoNation Inc. this week to French Gates, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\n\nTheir separation is expected to involve a wealth transfer on a scale that's only been seen in a few other divorces, though few details have yet emerged. It could also have ramifications for one of the most important philanthropic organizations on the planet. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given away in excess of $50 billion to support healthcare, education, gender equality and efforts to combat climate change.\n\nGates, the 65-year-old co-founder of Microsoft Corp. is worth $144.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. French Gates, 56, is a former Microsoft manager who's gained international prominence co-running the foundation, and more recently for starting Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company to advance 'social progress' in the U.S.\n\nBill Gates's biggest asset is Cascade Investment, which he created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. Cascade oversees a vast portfolio comprising real estate, energy and hospitality as well as stakes in dozens of public companies.\n\nThe biggest public position is agricultural-machinery maker Deere & Co., with Cascade holding more than 10% of the stock valued at about $12 billion, followed by an $11.8 billion stake in waste-collection company Republic Services Inc., Bloomberg data show. That's followed by Canadian National and Ecolab Inc.\n\nMost of the portfolio, overseen by money manager Michael Larson, is comprised of North American companies, but it also owns stock in Diageo Plc, the world's largest distiller, and London-based private-jet services firm Signature Aviation Plc.\n\nThe Gateses are also among the largest landowners in America and have homes including their 66,000 square-foot mansion in Medina, Washington.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

    "Text": "Speedy tracing systems, movement curbs have largely reined in the spread of COVID-19 in Australia.\n\nAustralian officials reinstated social distancing measures across greater Sydney on Thursday, as they scrambled to find missing tranmission links in a COVID-19 case connected to an Indian variant of the virus.\n\nWith many people expected to gather over the weekend for annual Mother's Day celebrations, the New South Wales state government restricted household gatherings to 20 guests and limited aged care facility visitors to two people per resident.\n\nMasks will be mandatory on public transport and at indoor venues. All the restrictions, which cover around 5.3 million people in the country's biggest metropolitan area, take effect at 5 p.m. local time and are scheduled to last until Monday morning.\n\n\"We believe this is a proportionate response to the risk we have ahead of us,\" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.\n\nThe measures, which also cover Sydney's neighbouring regions of Wollongong, the Central Coast and Blue Mountains, were spurred by the detection of COVID-19 in a 50-year-old man, who passed the infection to his wife.\n\nThe case, the first local transmission in NSW in more than a month, baffled health officials given the man had no known links to high-risk jobs or people.\n\nTesting has determined the man was infected with a variant first detected in India and genomic sequencing had linked the case to a returned traveller from the United States, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said on Thursday, but there was no clear transmission path between the two people.\n\n\"We can't find any direct link between our case, so what we're concerned about is there is another person that is as yet unidentified that infected our case,\" Mr Chant said.\n\nIt appeared to be the first time officials had reported the local transmission of an India virus variant in Australia.\n\nTests on the infected man had showed a higher viral load than typically seen in infected people, potentially increasing the chance that the man has spread the disease, officials said.\n\nNSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet entered self-isolation on Thursday after he visited a restaurant at the same time as the infected person, classifying him as a close contact, his office said. Perrottet, who attended a sitting of state parliament on Wednesday, has tested negative.\n\nAuthorities also asked thousands of residents in the city's inner west to seek testing for any mild flu symptoms after fragments of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were detected in the sewerage network used by several suburbs.\n\nSpeedy tracing systems, movement curbs and border restrictions have largely reined in the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, which has recorded 29,865 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nINDIA BAN\n\nThe federal government is currently under pressure to overturn a temporary travel ban on travellers, including its own citizens, from COVID-ravaged India. Australia has blocked all direct flights from the country until May 15.\n\nA report in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday, citing unidentified sources, said at least two repatriation flights will be dispatched to India every week from the middle of this month to bring home around 9,000 Australians.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison, however, said the situation would be constantly reviewed.\n\n\"We are not going to commit to that at this point,\" Mr Morrison told radio station 3AW on Thursday.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

Non-compliance of this second letter would be taken seriously,\" Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said in the second letter dispatched to state government two days after he wrote the first letter.\n\nMr Bhalla also asked the West Bengal Chief Secretary why adequate measures to stop the violence have not been taken so far. \"There are fresh reports which suggest that post-poll violence has not stopped. Immediate measures should be taken to stop violence and report regarding the same should be sent immediately,\" he wrote.\n\nA four-member team of the Home Ministry, headed by an Additional Secretary, has been sent to West Bengal to assess the ground situation, government officials said.\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Wednesday also took note of the post-poll violence that erupted in West Bengal after assembly election results were announced on May 2. The human rights body had requested its Deputy Inspector General (Investigation) to constitute a team to look into the matter. The team has been asked to conduct an on-the-spot fact-finding investigation and submit it in two weeks.\n\n\"Considering as a fit case of an alleged violation of Right to Life of the innocent citizens, the Commission has today taken suo-moto cognizance of the matter and has requested its DIG (Investigation) to constitute a team of the officers of the Investigation Division of the Commission to conduct an on the spot fact-finding investigation and to submit a report at the earliest, preferably within two weeks,\" the NHRC said.\n\nSeveral other human rights bodies such as the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and the National Commission for Women (NCW) have also raised concerns over reports of violence and sought an inquiry.\n\nBoth the BJP and the Left have slammed the Trinamool Congress and accused it of attacking their workers amid victory celebrations after the May 2 results.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress and the West Bengal Police have rebuffed most of the charges saying a large number of fake videos and images from older incidents were being spread on social media.\n\nOn Tuesday, BJP National President JP Nadda visited Bengal to meet the families of the victims assuring that justice will be served democratically. \"Mamata ji, what your party has done after victory, shows how much you and your party workers believe in democracy.

    "Text": "Indian strain is called a double mutant because of the presence of two changes in the virus's genome.\n\nThe good news is that the vaccines work against a new virus strain circulating in India that's spread to several other countries.\n\nThe bad news is it won't be only the new version of the pathogen to emerge from an outbreak of this scale, underscoring the urgency of mapping other possible variants that may be currently racing through India's tightly-packed population of 1.4 billion people.\n\nAs infections surge by more than 300,000 cases for 14 straight days, pushing India's tally past 20 million, the country's limited ability to track new mutations emerging from its outbreak is a growing concern for scientists.\n\nSecond- or even third-generation versions of the variant known as B.1.617 could already be circulating in India and some may be more dangerous, said William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor who now chairs think tank Access Health International.\n\n\"India has the necessary genome sequencing capabilities but it needs to have a mass surveillance program,\" Haseltine said. \"I'll be on the lookout for more and newer variants, given the opportunity the virus has had with such a massive outbreak.\"\n\nVariants are already outracing vaccination progress in many parts of the world, fueling bigger outbreaks that spread faster. While some rich nations that secured effective vaccines early have seen their epidemics wane, the virus is still spreading like wildfire in developing economies, prolonging the pandemic.\n\nSuper Mutant Debunked\n\nMutations occur when the virus replicates, and India's unprecedented surge is driving new cases to global records, even as richer economies like the U.S. and Israel re-open quickly. Fearing an influx of infections and mindful of B.1.617, Singapore, the U.K. and Tanzania are among countries that have curbed travel to and from India.\n\nAustralia has banned its citizens from returning from India and imposed penalties of roughly $50,000 and five years imprisonment for violators.\n\nThe India strain has been called a double mutant because of the presence of two changes in the virus's genome, called E484Q and L452R. Both affect a portion of the spike protein, called the receptor binding domain, that's key to the virus entering cells.\n\nSome researchers estimate that the B.1.617 variant is as transmissible as the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the U.K., thought to be as much as 70% more transmissible than earlier versions of the virus.\n\nYet initial analyses indicate that the India version, now classified a variant of interest by the World Health Organization, poses a limited threat and doesn't appear to be more dangerous.\n\nCovaxin, the inactivated-virus vaccine being made by India's Bharat Biotech International Ltd., and AstraZeneca Plc's vaccine, called Covishield in India, are effective against the strain in preventing serious illness, said Rakesh Mishra, director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, one of the labs analyzing virus samples. Data is still being gathered about the response to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, Mishra said, but it's likely to be effective.\n\nBioNTech SE Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he was confident the mRNA shot it's making with partner Pfizer Inc. would work against the India mutant though testing is still ongoing. \"The Indian variant has the same mutation that we've already investigated and against which our vaccine was also effective,\" he said last week.\n\nSingapore, which tightened social distancing restrictions this week after findings cases linked to the India variant, has also seen vaccines hold up well to prevent serious illness, said Kenneth Mak, director of medical services in city-state's health ministry. But \"vaccination does not prevent you from getting infected 100%,\" he said in a Tuesday briefing.\n\nRavindra Gupta's team at the University of Cambridge recently studied the two mutations that appear on the receptor binding domain of the India variant's spike protein. The team tested viruses made to simulate the variant against serum from nine people who had already received a single dose of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine.\n\n\"We wanted to know whether this double mutant really is a double whammy,\" said Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge's Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases. What they found was that while each of the mutations could partly evade neutralizing antibodies, the two mutations didn't combine to create an even greater ability to evade immune protection.\n\n\"They don't combine to make a super mutant,\" Gupta said. \"It kind of debunks this view that this double mutant is doubly evading neutralizing antibodies.\"\n\nHere is the REALLY IMPORTANT part. The combination of the two mutations gives a value of 4, in other words the two mutations DO NOT confer substantial antibody evasion and we can stop using the term 'Double Mutant'. \u2014 Gupta Lab, Cambridge (@GuptaR_lab) May 1, 2021\n\nWhile the findings ease concerns around B.1.617, researchers are turning to the next set of variants as India's outbreak continues to rage. Genomic surveillance can provide crucial information on the new forms of this shape-shifting virus -- critical in preventing subsequent waves and developing the next generation of vaccines.\n\nIn the U.S., recent studies published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that a variant that caused concern when it emerged in New York isn't more dangerous than earlier strains, while a pair of mutants that surfaced in southern California \"might more frequently cause discernible and severe illness than do nationally circulating lineages overall.\"\n\nThe WHO has been monitoring variants through a global working group of laboratories, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the agency's technical lead officer. Information about new variants is coming in \"fast and furious,\" she said.\n\nBut as its health system is stretched to breaking point and Prime Minister Narendra Modi resists calls for a lockdown, the country's labs are ill-equipped to keep up with the necessary monitoring. Genomic sequencing that can identify new strains and track their progress is still relatively sparse in India, where only about 11,000 viruses have been analyzed, according to Mishra.\n\nWhile countries like the U.K. monitor about 5% to 10% of cases, in India far fewer are sequenced. To do so would require analyzing tens of thousands of samples daily, and failing to leaves a huge blind spot, according to Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health in Rhode Island.\n\n\"What genomic surveillance does,\" he said, \"is it helps you really track where infections are going and how things are spreading in a way India was pretty blind to.\"\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

The mangalsutra is a sacred thread which is traditionally tied by the groom around the bride's neck on their wedding day. \"After the pheras when Tanuja and I tied the mangalsutra around each other's neck, I was so happy,\" recalls Shardul, who spoke to Humans of Bombay about why he chose to wear a mangalsutra and how that one decision made the couple a target of Internet trolls.\n\nShardul and Tanuja met in college, although their love story began four years after they graduated. \"We reconnected in the most unexpected way. She'd shared a Himesh Reshammiya song on Instagram and captioned it as 'torture'-I replied back saying 'maha torture'...that's how we started talking,\" says Shardul.\n\nWhen they met for tea after a few weeks and started talking about feminism, Shardul declared himself to be a \"hardcore feminist\".\n\n\"She looked at me as if she hadn't expected me to say that!\" he says.\n\nShardul and Tanuja dated for a year before they informed their parents, who were thrilled. In September 2020, as the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic subsided, they started planning their wedding.\n\n\"That's when I told Tanuja, 'Why is it that only a girl has to wear a mangalsutra? It makes no sense!' We were both equals, so I announced, 'Even I'll wear a mangalsutra on our wedding day!'\" Shardul tells Humans of Bombay.\n\nHis parents were surprised and relatives questioned his decision, but Shardul refused to budge, saying that wearing a mangalsutra to him represented equality.\n\n\"For some reason, the girl's family is 'supposed' to bear the cost of the wedding, but I went to Tanuja's parents and told them that we'd split all costs,\" he said further.\n\nThe day before their wedding, Tanuja asked him if he would wear the mangalsutra after the wedding as well - and Shardul said he would. Their wedding went off smoothly. \"Even though a few male relatives weren't happy about it, they didn't say anything to us,\" says Shardul, referring to the exchange of mangalsutras.\n\nHowever, the next day, the newlyweds woke up to \"terrible backlash\" on social media. \"A digital newspaper had picked up our story,\" says Shardul.\n\n\"People started commenting- 'Now wear a saree also', 'Do you bleed once a month?' Even liberals started trolling me, 'This is not the way to support gender equality,' they said.\"\n\nShardul says he expected some trolling to come his way, but the extent of it surprised him. \"At first, Tanuja was affected by it, but it's been 4 months now and we're just done with the trolls,\" he says.\n\n\"Because Tanuja and I can define our relationship better than anyone else; we support each other's work, believe in each other's dreams, and are in this journey together. So, who cares what the world thinks?\" Shardul concludes.\n\nYou can read his post below:\n\nShardul and Tanuja's story has struck a chord with the Internet, racking up more than 82,000 'likes' on Instagram and thousands more on Facebook.\n\n\"Proud of your decision and God bless you both with lots of strength and happiness,\" wrote one Facebook user.\n\n\"I respect groom's feelings. I don't think he has done anything wrong. He has worn mangalsutra as a symbol of equality and portrayed his thinking,\" said another.\n\nIn 2019, another wedding with a difference had gone viral on social media. At that wedding, the bride's father refused to do kanyadaan or give away the bride, saying that his daughter is \"not property to give away\".\n\nClick for more trending news",

Image (L) courtesy @radhikamadan) and (R) courtesy @pulkitsamrat)\n\nAt a time when COVID-19 cases in Indian are increasing by the day, the government has reiterated that vaccination is the way forward. Many of our favourite actors and actresses, too, have shared this message, urging people to take the jab as soon as possible. Once the government allowed all those above the age of 18 to get vaccinated, many young celebrities led by example and got their shots recently. For instance, actress Radhika Madan shared a photo of herself getting vaccinated on Wednesday. In the image, the 'Angrezi Medium' actress can be seen in a pair of shorts and a comfortable T-shirt. She has taken care to wear a double mask and a face shield as well.\n\nUrging fans to get vaccinated, she wrote in the caption, \"One step at a time #vaccinated... I urge everyone to get themselves registered and get their shot and please take full precautions at the vaccination centres. Wear a double mask, sanitize your hands, maintain distance and don't panic. Don't forget to get a good night's sleep the day before and stay well hydrated.\"\n\nRadhika was congratulated by her fans and photographer Atul Kasbekar also left happy emoticons in the comment section.\n\nLike Radhika, actor Pulkit Samrat shared a photo of himself getting vaccinated on Instagram. Pulkit, who is seen in a mask and face shield in the photo, wrote, \"#Jab We Met. This is our best form of defence. Be safe.\" Fashion designer Manish Malhotra and celebrity hairstylist Aalim Hakim congratulated Pulkit on taking the first step towards protecting himself from coronavirus.\n\nPreviously, actors such as Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit had shared images of having received both COVID-19 vaccination shots. Sharing an image of herself getting the second dose of vaccination, Madhuri urged her fans and social media followers to follow suit. The 53-year-old actress wrote, \"Got my second jab today. I urge everyone to get vaccinated as soon as it's available to you.\"\n\nHer co-star of many films, actor Anil Kapoor, 64, also kept his fans informed about his vaccination progress. Sharing an image of himself getting the shot, Anil said, \"Done with the second dose.\"\n\nOn Thursday, data showed that India had recorded over 4.12 lakh new cases, taking the caseload to 2.06 crore in the last 24 hours. Within the same timeframe, 3,980 people died of Covid in India, taking the total fatalities to 2,30,168.\n\nIf there was ever a time to emulate your favourite movie stars, it is now.

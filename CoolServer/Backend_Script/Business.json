    "Text": "File photo for representation purpose only\n\nMUMBAI: Asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) have asked the RBI to let them sell assets of defaulting promoters back to them. They have also asked the central bank to allow corporates and high net worth individuals to invest in troubled loans through the securities issued by ARCs.\n\nThe Association of ARCs in India recently responded to the RBI\u2019s call for suggestions to overhaul their structure in the country. ARCs were created under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act ( SARFAESI ), 2002, which allowed lenders to seize assets.\n\nThe role of ARCs reduced after the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016, which enabled banks to sell the defaulting business to a new promoter. To prevent defaulters from buying back their companies at a discount, Section 29A was incorporated. This blacklisted defaulting promoters. After the IBC Act, the RBI had asked ARCs to stick to the principles of its Section 29 and not sell loans to promoters even outside the bankruptcy process.\n\nAccording to the ARC association, the SARFAESI Act allows them to sell assets to the borrower or the promoter group of companies. \u201cHence, following the spirit of Section 29A of IBC would be contradictory to the provision of SARFAESI Act,\u201d it said in a note.\n\nAnother request from the ARCs is that they be allowed to pick up equity in bankrupt companies as a \u2018resolution applicant\u2019 in IBC cases. In the bidding for RCom, the RBI had rejected the winning bid by UV ARC, stating that the SARFAESI law disqualifies them from holding equity in a company.\n\nIn a note to members, the association said it has sought a level playing field with the National Asset Reconstruction Company ( NARC ), which is proposed to be set up by public sector banks, and which will be backed with some form of government guarantee. \u201cGovernment has announced the formation of new ARC/asset management company to takeover non-performing assets (NPAs) from different banks to clean up their books and work on resolving those NPAs . We request that special regulatory dispensation/benefit if any given to proposed ARC should apply to all existing ARCs and level playing field from regulatory perspective be given to all existing ARCs,\u201d the association said.\n\nARCs raise money for buying bad loans by selling security receipts (SRs) that entitle investors a share of the recovery proceeds. To ensure that they retain skin in the game, the RBI has asked ARCs to invest at least 15% in the SRs they issue. ARCs have asked for this minimum investment to be brought down to 2.5% in cases where the bank selling the bad loan is not the investor. Other suggestions include a request to be classified as non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ), which will enable ARCs to borrow from banks.\n\n",

    "Text": "Holding tanks are seen at Colonial Pipeline's Linden Junction Tank Farm in Woodbridge, New Jersey.\n\nWASHINGTON: Ransom-seeking hackers have broken into Colonial Pipeline , prompting the company to shut one of America's major arteries for fuel delivery.\n\nHere is a look at what we know, and what we don't, about one of the most disruptive digital shakedown efforts to hit a US company.\n\nWHO IS INVOLVED?\n\nAlpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline and the US government have both blamed ransomware for the massive outage, pointing the finger at cybercriminal gangs who routinely hold data and computer networks hostage in exchange for digital currency payments.\n\nThere is no official word on which group is believed to have carried out the intrusion - and attributing malicious activity online can be extremely difficult - but a former US official and three industry sources told Reuters a group dubbed \" DarkSide \" was among the suspects. If so, that would lay the responsibility on a new but professional group of criminals believed to be operating out of the former Soviet republics.\n\nCybersecurity FireEye is involved with the incident response, according to three industry sources.\n\nHOW BAD IS IT?\n\nRansomware can deal catastrophic damage to an organization's network by locking away critical data or even wrecking computers beyond repair. But the effect on the actual nuts and bolts of energy companies' operations varies.\n\nA destructive cyberattack on Saudi Aramco in 2012 crippled the oil giant's computer network but left production more-or-less unscathed. By contrast, a more recent ransomware incident at Norsk Hydro temporarily pushed the aluminum maker to switch away from automated production at its smelters.\n\nExperts say the severity of the Colonial case will depend on whether the ransomware made its way into the company's operational technology network, which interfaces with the pipeline itself. Earlier this year, US government officials announced https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-049a that an intrusion at an unnamed natural gas compression plant that spilled over into its operational technology network forced a two-day shut down of its entire pipeline.\n\nColonial has not given any public indication as to the reach of the ransomware outbreak, but Robert M. Lee, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Dragos, said he believed Colonial's operations network was shut down proactively \"to make sure that nothing spread into those systems.\"\n\nHe said that will hopefully translate to \"a temporary outage versus something that would be more sustained.\"\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nUS government officials are working with Colonial to help it recover while scrambling to avoid more severe fuel supply disruptions should the outage continue.\n\nColonial's pipeline network serves major US airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic, and experts say regional fuel supplies could be impacted if the pipeline stays shut.\n\n\"A one-to-two-day outage is really a minor inconvenience,\" said Andrew Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates . But by day four or five, he said, \"we could see a much greater widespread impact through large areas throughout the mid-Atlantic and the southeast.\"\n\nWhether the pipeline stays shut that long in turn depends on how deeply the hackers penetrated Colonial's network - and how soon cybersecurity experts can pull them out.\n\n",

Journalists from countries as tiny as Guinea-Bissau had been invited to sign agreements with their Chinese counterparts. The Chinese government was distributing versions of its propaganda newspaper China Daily in English \u2014 and also Serbian. A Filipino journalist estimated that more than half of the stories on a Philippines newswire came from the Chinese state agency Xinhua. A Kenyan media group raised money from Chinese investors, then fired a columnist who wrote about China\u2019s suppression of its Uyghur minority. Journalists in Peru faced intense social media criticism from combative Chinese government officials.\n\nWhat seemed, in each country, like an odd local anomaly looked, all told, like a vast, if patchwork, strategy to create an alternative to a global news media dominated by outlets like the BBC and CNN, and to insert Chinese money, power and perspective into the media in almost every country in the world.\n\nBut the study raised an obvious question: What is China planning to do with this new power?\n\nThe answer comes in a second report, which is set to be released on Wednesday by the International Federation of Journalists, a Brussels-based union of journalism unions whose mission gives it a global bird's-eye view into news media almost everywhere. The group, which shared a copy with me, hired an author of the first report, Louisa Lim, to canvass journalists in 54 countries. The interviews \u201creveal an activation of the existing media infrastructure China has put in place globally,\u201d Ms. Lim, a former NPR bureau chief in Beijing who is now a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, wrote in the report. \u201cAs the pandemic started to spread, Beijing used its media infrastructure globally to seed positive narratives about China in national media, as well as mobilizing more novel tactics such as disinformation.\u201d",

This coincided with electioneering hitting peak to elect new governments in five states including West Bengal.\n\nNo sooner had voting ended, oil companies indicated an impending increase in retail prices in view of firming trends in international oil markets.\n\nThey said prices have been on a continuous uptrend since April 27, crude oil price is hovering near USD 70-per-barrel mark.\n\nCentral and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. The union government levies \u20b932.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and \u20b931.80 on diesel.\n\nIn Mumbai, the petrol price was hiked to \u20b997.86 a litre on Monday from \u20b997.61, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 89.17 from R\u20b988.82, the price notification showed.",

In Delhi, petrol now comes for Rs 91.53 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 82.06 per litre.\n\nWhile petrol prices had crossed the Rs 100-mark in some places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh a few days back, Maharashtra's Parbhani joined the league on Monday. Petrol in Parbhani was priced at Rs 100.20 a litre, while in Bhopal it came for Rs 99.55 a litre.\n\nThe fuel is sold at Rs 102.42 a litre in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan and at Rs 102.12 in Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThis is the second time this year that rates in some parts have crossed the Rs 100-a litre mark. Rates had breached the physiological mark for the first time in mid-February.\n\nFuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIn five increases in the last one week, petrol price has risen by Rs 1.14 per litre and diesel by Rs 1.33 - more than neutralising all of the reduction that came between March 24 and April 15.\n\nAfter raising petrol price by a record Rs 21.58 per litre and diesel by Rs 19.18 since the government raised excise duty to an all-time high in March last year, state-owned fuel retailers, IOC, BPCL and HPCL had reduced petrol price by 67 paise a litre and diesel by 74 paise per litre effected between March 24 and April 15.\n\nOil companies, who have in recent months resorted to unexplained freeze in rate revision, had hit a pause button after cutting prices marginally on April 15. This coincided with electioneering hitting peak to elect new governments in five states including West Bengal.\n\nNo sooner had voting ended, oil companies indicated an impending increase in retail prices in view of firming trends in international oil markets.\n\nThey said prices have been on a continuous uptrend since April 27, crude oil price is hovering near USD 70-per-barrel mark.\n\nCentral and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. The union government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 on diesel.\n\nIn Mumbai, the petrol price was hiked to Rs 97.86 a litre on Monday from Rs 97.61, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 89.17 from Rs 88.82, the price notification showed.\"\n\n9:30 AM\n\nDon\u2019t sweat the small stuff\n\nBeing alive, being well, and being safe is all that matters today. Everything else is small stuff and not worth your sweat right now. In case you have been fretting about the following issues to do with your money, let\u2019s just allay some of your concerns.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried no end about the low interest your deposit is fetching you and making calls to banks or visiting their branches (with masks), to know where there are better rates, let it go. While the RBI is using many tools to keep the government bond rates low, the creeping inflation is slowly pushing rates up. If you have not noticed, some of the large NBFCs deposits have started increasing their deposit rates offered to senior citizens and you will likely see many such hikes slowly. Just renew your deposits for shorter periods of 3-6 months so that you can lock into higher rates a while later. If you have longer horizons, go for floating rate bonds from RBI or the other small savings schemes which still offer good rates.",

Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nA little over a year after making its debut in iOS, audio-chatting app Clubhouse is now opening its account in Android. The app was launched last March exclusively for iOS users to let them connect with others via chat rooms sans cameras.\n\nBy the time it was ready for general use to all Apple users in June, \u2018zoom fatigue\u2019 was starting to set in, making people log on to Clubhouse to socialise. Within ten months of its launch, the app enabled over two million people, from musicians to stock traders, to meet, to talk and connect on the platform.\n\nClubhouse\u2019s success has made several other social media firms start their own versions of audio-chatting feature. Twitter launched Spaces for its users to meet and join impromptu discussions started by those they follow. Facebook is said to be working on a similar interface that can be accessed by people via its Messenger app.\n\nEven enterprise chat service Slack is said to be experimenting a Clubhouse-like feature for its users. Most recently, Reddit said it is testing an audio-only chat feature to let its users host live discussions within its communities.\n\nAs an increasing number of platforms are opening up their apps for audio-based chat forums, Clubhouse is doubling its efforts to get a slice of the Android pie. Just a few weeks ago, Clubhouse closed a new round of funding led by Andrew Chen of venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz - - the app was valued at $4 billion.\n\nNow, it is starting to test waters in a market where Twitter, Facebook and Reddit have already set sail. But Clubhouse founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth are planning to wade through Android the same way they did in iOS, through invite-only sign ups. When Davison and Seth launched the app for iPhone users, people were given access through invitation links.\n\nWith its Android launch, Clubhouse plans to navigate the same way. \u201cAs a part of the effort to keep the growth measured, we will be continuing the waitlist and invite system, ensuring that each new community member can bring along a few close friends,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\n\nThe app will be first rolled out in beta, starting with the U.S., followed by other English-speaking countries. In the next few weeks, Clubhouse plans to collect feedback from the community and fix any issues before a full roll out for all Android users.",

These were given exemption from Customs Duty/health cess even earlier. Hon. CM @MamataOfficial, may notice that items in your list are covered,\u201d she said, adding \u201cFull exemption from Customs duties, including IGST, is already available to ALL COVID relief material [not confined to a list] imported by @IndianRedCross for free distribution in the country.\u201d\n\n2/ A list of items for COVID relief granted exemption from IGST for imports was issued on 3rd May\u201921. These were given exemption from Customs Duty/health cess even earlier.\n\n\n\nHon. CM @MamataOfficial , may notice that items in your list are covered. @ANI @PIB_India @PIBKolkata pic.twitter.com/zuDJP1vOB0 \u2014 Nirmala Sitharaman (@nsitharaman) May 9, 2021\n\nMs. Sitharaman said: \u201cWith effect from 3 May, 2021, full exemption from all duties has been provided to Remdesivir injections, Remdesivir API, and for a chemical for the manufacture of this drug.\n\n\u201cAlso to Medical Oxygen, equipment used for the manufacture, storage and transportation of oxygen, equipment used for providing oxygen therapy to COVID patients such as Oxygen Concentrators, Ventilators, Non-invasive oxygen masks etc.\n\n\u201cAlso to Inflammatory diagnostic kits and reagents for COVID testing and COVID vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis exemption applies to all above mentioned goods when imported free of cost for free distribution in the country by any entity, State government, relief agency or autonomous body on the basis of a certificate issued by a State government.\n\n\u201cIn order to augment the availability of these items, government has also provided full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess to their commercial imports.\u201d\n\nMs. Sitharaman further said: \u201cGST at rates varying from 5% [on vaccines], 12% [COVID drugs, oxygen concentrators] is applicable to domestic supplies and commercial import of these items.\n\n\u201cIf IGST \u20b9100 is collected on an item, \u20b950 accrues to the Centre and the States each as CGST and SGST respectively. Further 41% of the CGST revenue is devolved to States. So out of a collection of \u20b9100, as much as \u20b970.50 is the States\u2019 share.\n\n\u201cIf full exemption from GST were given, the domestic producers of these items would be unable to offset taxes paid on their inputs and input services and would pass these on to the end consumers by increasing their price.\n\n\u201cCOVID vaccines are being provided free of cost by the GoI to those who are 45 years of age & above and to all frontline workers. On Government supplies, GST is also paid by the government.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the GST collected on vaccine, half is earned by the Centre and the other half by the States. Further, 41% of Centre\u2019s collections also get devolved to the States,\u201d she noted, adding \u201cSo States end up receiving almost 70% of the total revenue collected from vaccines. In fact, a nominal 5% GST is in the interest of the domestic manufacturer of vaccine and in the interest of the citizens. If full exemption from GST is given, vaccine manufacturers would not be able to offset their input taxes and would pass them on to the end consumer/citizen by increasing the price.\"\n\n\u201cA 5% GST rate ensures that the manufacturer is able to utilise ITC and in case of overflow of ITC, claim refund. Hence exemption to vaccine from GST would be counterproductive without benefiting the consumer,\u201d Ms. Sitharaman said.",

India has recorded more than 2.4 lakh Covid deaths, according to the latest Union health ministry data.In an attempt to ease the pain of families of deceased employees, several organisations are offering benefits like a one-time compassionate payment, financial sponsorship for education of their children and an employment opportunity to the spouses. The number of Covid casualties at individual firms is, however, not known as regulations mandate listed companies to disclose the deaths of key managerial personnel only. J Sagar Associates, a leading law firm in India, said that as the count of Covid deaths is spiraling by the minute, companies are stepping forward to provide bereavement support to grieving families. \u201cApart from taking responsibility for children\u2019s education and continuing disbursement of an employee\u2019s full salary up to two years, companies are covering hospitalisation, funeral and vaccination expenses,\u201d said Minu Dwivedi, a partner at J Sagar Associates.Many companies have expanded their group term insurance to include Covid protection for their employees. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is offering an insurance cover of Rs 23 lakh, or an amount equivalent to six times of an employee\u2019s annual compensation, whichever is higher, to his/her family in the event of the person\u2019s death due to Covid. TCS employs close to 5 lakh people \u2014 the largest employer of software professionals in the country (more than 70% of those are based in India).Muthoot Finance, India\u2019s largest gold loan NBFC, has decided to pay the next 24 months\u2019 salary to the spouse or mother of a deceased employee if s/he had completed three years of service. For employees whose total period of service is less than three years, the payout will be for the next 12 months.ICICI Lombard, the country\u2019s leading private non-life insurer, will grant employment to the deceased staff\u2019s spouse if the latter has suitable education qualifications and fits the available role. Among other support endeavours, it will also offer terminal benefits (like provident fund and gratuity) to the family of the deceased employee. This would be done even if s/he had not completed the designated period required to get the gratuity.Companies have extended the group term insurance to include Covid financial protection for distributors and third-party packaging units\u2019 people too. \u201cThe second wave has affected many of our employees, partners and their families across India,\u201d said Tata Consumer Products MD Sunil D\u2019Souza. \u201cWe have covered all frontline employees, including partner workforce in sales and manufacturing through specific medical assistance, hospitalisations and insurance programmes,\u201d D\u2019Souza added.Last week, Kotak Mahindra Bank revealed it lost 17 employees to Covid in fiscal 2021 and another 17 last month. \u201cWhat we lost in the (last fiscal), we have lost in April 2021 alone,\u201d said Uday Kotak, MD of India\u2019s third-largest private sector bank.K Raheja Corp, leading commercial and residential property developer, is offering a term cover equal to one-year gross salary to family members in the event of any employee succumbing to Covid. \u201cWhile nothing can replace the loss of a loved one, we endeavour to assist in improving financial security with term insurance,\u201d said the company\u2019s HR chief Urvi Aradhya.In a LinkedIn post, glassware brand Borosil, which lost four employees to Covid, had said it will sponsor the education of their children up to graduation in India.HCL Technologies is offering Rs 30-lakh insurance, Rs 7-lakh employees deposit linked insurance and an amount equal to the annual salary of the deceased professional to the family members, as TOI reported in its Saturday edition.",

Japanese shares gained 0.91%.\n\nUS non-farm payrolls data on Friday showed jobs growth unexpectedly slowed in April, which gave equities a lift but put downward pressure on the dollar and US Treasury yields.\n\nOn Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rose to record closing highs after disappointing data on the U.S. jobs market eased concerns about a spike in consumer prices.\n\nIn recent weeks, some investors had been placing bets that a robust US economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates earlier than the central bank has outlined.\n\nHowever, the weak nonfarm payrolls report caused a rapid reversal in some of these trades, which rippled through stocks, bonds, and major currencies.\n\nThe focus now shifts to US consumer price data due on Wednesday, which will help investors determine whether they need to scale back their inflation expectations even further.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of global stock markets hit a record high on expectations that low rates will continue to spur lending and economic growth.\n\nBack home, Bandhan Bank shares will be in focus, as the lender on Saturday reported an 80% dip in its March quarter net profit at \u20b9103 crore, as it wrote off a huge portfolio of loans in the flagship microlending business by recognising stress upfront.

    "Text": "MUMBAI : When the going gets tough, the tough get going. That probably sums up what food and grocery retailer Avenue Supermarts Ltd\u2019s financial year 2021 (FY21) has been like. Avenue runs the DMart chain of retail stores.\n\nThe company\u2019s first half of FY21 was terribly hit by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic with standalone revenues declining by around 34% year-on-year in the June quarter. Revenue drop was curtailed to 12% in the September quarter. Subsequent quarters saw further improvement. In fact, revenues increased in the December quarter by 10% year-on-year. Revenue growth further improved in the March quarter at 18%.\n\nBut the big problem now is that India is witnessing a second wave and that means Avenue\u2019s recovery would be cut short. JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd\u2019s analysts sum it up beautifully, \u201cProgression here onwards could have been as if nothing had happened in between, had the second wave of the pandemic not struck.\"\n\nThe broker added in a report on 8 May, \u201cDMart\u2019s March quarter report reflects the business\u2019 near-total return to normalcy within 9-12 months of lockdown-related disruptions first setting-in during March 2020. Revenue per store is up 8% versus March 2019 quarter level with margin also higher versus two-year ago level.\"\n\nThe new covid wave has led to the imposition of various restrictions across regions, which is likely to hit Avenue\u2019s revenues in the foreseeable future. Taking note of this, analysts have trimmed their revenue estimates for FY22.\n\nAvenue said, \u201cIn general, more than 80% of our stores are operating for significantly lower number of hours (not exceeding four hours per day) or are even shut for operations for one to weeks or shut on weekends. These shut downs are having an adverse and severe impact on our revenues.\"\n\nIn FY21, the company opened 22 new stores and converted 2 stores into fulfilment centres for Avenue E-Commerce Ltd, taking the total store count to 234 as on March-end.\n\nComing to the March quarter results, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) margin stood at 8.4%, representing a decline of 86 basis points vis-\u00e0-vis the December quarter. One basis point is 0.01%. For perspective: Ebitda margin in the March 2020 and March 2019 quarters stood at 6.7% and 7.5%, respectively.\n\nOverall, for FY21, Avenue\u2019s revenues declined by 3.6% year-on-year but net earnings fell at a sharper rate of almost 14%. Weak operating margin performance weighed on profitability for the year, as Ebitda margins contracted by 128 basis points. In FY21, foods, non-foods (FMCG) and general merchandise and apparel, accounted for 57.4%, 19.69% and 22.90% of the revenues, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, in early deals on Monday, Avenue\u2019s shares were trading marginally up on the National Stock Exchange. Understandably, covid-19 challenges have weighed on the sentiments for the stock, which has declined about 13% from its 52-weeks highs on 5 March. True, valuations have corrected a bit, but the stock still remains pricey.\n\nAs ICICI Securities Ltd\u2019s analysts point out in a report on 9 May, \u201cAfter the material (more than 35%) stock underperformance over last one year, valuations have become a tad more palatable (stock now trades at 73 times price-to-earnings ratio and 50 times Ebitda on FY2023e).\" The broker\u2019s target price of Rs2,600 is around 12% lower than DMart current share price.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "Investors in the Ceat Ltd stock are in for a bumpy ride as input cost inflation has started to impact the tyre maker\u2019s margins, despite price hikes. In the March quarter, consolidated gross margins contracted by 360 basis points (bps) sequentially to 42%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Compared to the year-ago period, gross margins shrank by 370bps. The decline in margins is 150-200bps higher than the Street\u2019s expectations.\n\nRaw material cost per kilogram increased by 8-10% quarter-on-quarter in Q4FY21 due to a sharp surge in the raw material basket, the Ceat management said in a post-earnings conference call. Of this, a 6-7% impact was partially offset by a 3% price hike and the rest was reflected in the contraction in gross margin, it said.\n\nThe management said that raw material cost inflation is expected to further increase by around 10% sequentially in Q1FY22. Thus, there is a need for price hikes to maintain margins at the current level, it said. Also, an inferior product mix with a higher share of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) segment added to the pressure.\n\nView Full Image Satish Kumar/Mint\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts warned of increased margin pressure in the coming quarters. Competitive pressure and demand slowdown because of the second covid wave would make it challenging for Ceat to raise prices further. Ceat did not hike prices in April. The Ceat management has said it will focus on cost-cutting measures to partly offset the impact of cost inflation headwinds. Still, a near-term margin compression is a given, analysts said.\n\nBesides, Ceat\u2019s fresh capital expenditure plan is seen as a short-term dampener. Ceat has announced additional capital expenditure of \u20b91,210 crore, which will be spent over the next four years for expansion at its Chennai unit. The rationale for the new capex was to expand market share in the truck and bus radial (TBR) segment and capitalize on the export opportunity.\n\n\u201cAs per our estimates, this will increase the TBR capacity by 40% from the existing capacity. This is a very aggressive capacity ramp-up plan by the company to make further inroads into the TBR segment,\" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 6 May.\n\nWhile this greenfield expansion would be beneficial in the longer term, for now, it would weigh on the firm\u2019s cash flows, cautioned analysts. Shares of the company ended Friday\u2019s session down 4% on the NSE at \u20b91,285. In the past one year, the stock has rallied by 75% and has already surpassed its pre-covid high of \u20b91,068 seen in February 2020. Tailwinds of soft commodity prices drove this rally and with raw material cost now turning into a headwind some downside pressure on the stock is likely, analysts said.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "Investors are bracing for market fallout as state after state locks itself down in India to contain the spread of the coronavirus as infections and deaths surge.\n\nMore than two thirds of states are shut if assessed by their contribution to national output, analysts at Jefferies calculated last week. Tamil Nadu, which houses foreign manufacturers including BMW and Dell, will also close from Monday, while Delhi extended its lockdown for another week. The measures come as pressure builds on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to impose strict nationwide curbs as he did last year.\n\nAll of that is forcing a reassessment among investors who had hoped that less-severe curbs would soften the blow to economic growth. Earlier in May, India\u2019s central bank assured markets that it expects the dent in aggregate demand to be moderate in comparison with a year ago, with \u201ccontainment measures being localized and targeted.\"\n\nThe news of strict lockdowns in several states may hurt sentiment ahead, Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking Ltd., wrote in a report. Investors will be watching key macroeconomic data including inflation and factory output this week as well as the vaccine drive, he said.\n\nVaccine shortages have complicated efforts to tame the outbreak, leaving investors assessing Modi\u2019s next moves and guessing how long states will have to remain shut. Amid the uncertainty, foreign investors pulled $1.9 billion from India\u2019s stocks and debt in April, the biggest outflow in a year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWhile India has refrained from a national lockdown thus far given its huge economic costs, the scales are tipping fast towards humanitarian benefits of curbing mass transmission, as new infections continue to rise with no peak in sight,\" said Chang Wei Liang, an analyst at DBS Bank. \u201cEven without a lockdown, mobility data for Indian cities are already showing that less and less people are moving out of their homes. This implies a natural brake to retail spending and business investment, until mass viral transmission ceases.\"\n\nHere\u2019s how the crisis is impacting markets:\n\nSovereign Bonds\n\nRecent interventions from the Reserve Bank of India have kept yields on 10-year sovereign bonds in check. But, the lockdowns could make it hard to keep borrowing costs low for much longer\n\nAny revenue shortfall would stoke fears of a further rise in government borrowings, already near records, adding upward pressure on yields\n\nEarlier this month, the central bank announced the second tranche of its Government Securities Acquisition Programme -- India\u2019s version of quantitative easing -- under which it will buy 350 billion rupees ($4.8 billion) of sovereign bonds on May 20. Read about more steps that the RBI can take here\n\nThe lockdowns risk higher prices for everything from essential drugs to cars, due to the disruption of supply chains. Consumer-price inflation was already on course to test the upper limit of the RBI\u2019s 2%-6% target, and recent gains in wholesale prices signal more pressure. If those strains build, the RBI may struggle to sell bonds to investors at current yields\n\nRupee\n\nRelative progress fighting the pandemic has been an important factor in global currency markets. India and South Africa present a case study in that among the so-called Fragile Five emerging-markets: Turkey, Brazil, South Africa, India and Indonesia\n\nIndia\u2019s rupee is down about 0.5% against the dollar this quarter even after a recent rebound, while South Africa\u2019s rand has gained 5.1%. Read more about the rupee outlook\n\nIndia is facing the world\u2019s worst outbreak, contributing to half of the fresh infections in the world, while South Africa has seen new cases fall about 90% from a recent peak in January. India reported 669 infections per 100,000 people over the past month, about 10 times that of South Africa, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data compiled by Johns Hopkins University\n\nThe rupee has slipped down the rankings relative to Asian peers after leading the pack in the first quarter. Any national lockdown could deal a further blow\n\nStocks\n\nJefferies forecasts India\u2019s economy will grow 10.2% in the year through March 2022, down 3 percentage points from its initial outlook. The figure already must be taken with a grain of salt given the contraction in the year-ago period. Any slowdown could weigh on corporate earnings\n\nAnalysts have started to cut price targets for stocks of some of the biggest banks and automobile giants\n\n\u201cMarkets will correct if the government announces a nationwide lockdown,\" said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer at Axis Securities Ltd. \u201cHowever, the critical factor will be the duration. The longer any lockdown is, the greater will be the correction.\"\n\nCorporate Bonds\n\nGoldman Sachs turned neutral on Indian credits last month, expecting limited room for outperformance\n\nCiting headwinds due to lockdowns, research firm CreditSights also changed its recommendation last month on local companies including Indian Oil Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. to underperform\n\nDBS Bank warned that the market is getting complacent after India\u2019s dollar bonds showed some signs of recovery after a sell-off in the first half of April\n\nInvestors may be too optimistic given the likelihood of a more persistent impact from the pandemic fallout on the finances of companies and households, it said\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

    "Text": "Hero MotoCorp Ltd\u2019s Q4 numbers do have some things to cheer about, no doubt. With sales realizations improving, the operating metrics exceeded the Street\u2019s expectations. But this could not quite prop up the stock, which dipped 1.8% on Friday.\n\nChallenges are plenty on the road ahead. With covid-19 roiling the markets, volume growth is likely to skid in the coming months.\n\nSome of that slowdown is already visible in Q4 sales volumes, which dipped 15% sequentially to 1.56 million vehicles. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis though, volumes grew 17.5% because of a low base as the nationwide lockdown hit sales in Q4 last year.\n\nAnalysts point out that after two successive quarters of decent sales of more than 1.8 million vehicles in Q2 and Q3, dealer inventories have increased. This resulted in Q4 revenues dipping about 11% sequentially. One positive takeaway is that Hero managed to improve realizations considerably after several quarters.\n\nView Full Image Satish Kumar/Mint\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFourth quarter volumes were down 15% quarter-on-quarter, but the average selling price improved 460 basis points sequentially. Gross profit per vehicle was commendably up 5% sequentially, despite commodity cost pressures,\" said a Jefferies India client note.\n\nAnalysts see the firm\u2019s tie-ups in the recent past such as with Harley-Davidson and Gogoro Inc. for electric vehicles (EVs) should be beneficial in the coming quarters. \u201cHero\u2019s longer-term strategy of global tie-ups for electric vehicles (Gogoro) and the premium segment (Harley) is encouraging. How long the current slowdown will last has to be monitored as the rural segment is now being impacted due to covid,\" said Aditya Makharia, analyst, HDFC Securities.\n\nBut the ongoing second wave of the pandemic is a dampener. Investors will again be banking on the annual monsoon for two-wheeler demand to revive as May and June could see sales decline due to partial lockdowns in several states. April wholesales have declined by about 35% over March, which is a steep drop.\n\nTo top it, input costs are rising. Thus, it could become more difficult to manage costs. International steel prices have surged 27% year-to-date which could squeeze operating margins in the coming quarters. Further, price increases may not be possible. \u201cPrice increases have to be calibrated as retail demand is weak, and might be required to be phased out,\" said analysts at Dolat Capital Market in a client note.\n\nAfter racing to an all-time high in February, backed by the strong recovery in the second half of FY21, the stock has hit potholes. It is down about 21% from its highs. For now, the stock\u2019s valuations are not too stiff at about 14 times FY23 earnings as per Bloomberg consensus estimates, but the pressure on the stock may be high till domestic recovery starts to revive after the second wave of covid-19.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "Tata Consumer Products Ltd\u2019s shares have had investors\u2019 attention for some time now. In calendar year 2020, the shares surged as much as 84% on the NSE, easily making it one of the best-performing consumer stocks. After the sharp re-rating, 2021 has begun on a relatively slow note with the shares gaining almost 7% so far.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, valuations are no doubt expensive. In fact, they are now higher than that of peer Britannia Industries Ltd. Based on Bloomberg data, the Tata Consumer stock now trades at 49 times one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio versus 45 times of Britannia. Of course, this wasn\u2019t always the case. Before the impact of the pandemic started reflecting, Tata Consumer\u2019s shares traded at around 34 times one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio on 1 January 2020 vis-\u00e0-vis Britannia\u2019s 46 times.\n\nAs such, Tata Consumer\u2019s investors appear to be factoring a good portion of optimism on the growth front. But March quarter (Q4FY21) results announced last week weren\u2019t particularly encouraging, after which the stock fell about 4%. Consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) declined by 2.6% over the same period last year to \u20b9300 crore vis-\u00e0-vis Bloomberg consensus estimates of \u20b9353 crore. \u201cConsolidated Ebitda growth for the quarter was impacted by tea inflation in India and increased A&P investments,\" the company said.\n\nView Full Image Satish Kumar/Mint\n\n\n\n\n\nEbitda margins contracted by 294 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 9.9%. One basis point is 0.01%. While margins were expected to be hit due to a sharp rise in tea prices, Q4FY21 margin is lower than expectations. Nonetheless, Ebitda margin decline was better than the 623bps compression in gross profit margin.\n\nEven so, analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd point have noted two aspects in the March quarter report that merit attention and monitoring. One, Sampann portfolio grew just 2% during the quarter. Tata Consumer has said the volatility in the pulses market has impacted growth. According to JM Financial, \u201cA business that is all of \u20b9400 crore in size p.a. should not have been impacted so badly by such macro events.\" It is also worth noting that the growth in salt revenue was robust in Q4FY21, boosting the firm\u2019s India foods segment.\n\nSecond, the international beverages business was especially weak. \u201cWhilst there is some high-base effect here due to pantry-loading in March quarter last year, the imputed \u2018normalized\u2019 growth rate seems to remind us that these are businesses that would continue to exhibit low-growth characteristics over the medium-term, once low-hanging fruits therein are plucked,\" said JM Financial.\n\nGoing ahead, the pandemic brings some uncertainty in the foreseeable future. Inflation in tea is expected to moderate with new crop and that would be a key monitorable for investors. The firm has said it will continue to drive competitive volume growth. For now though, valuations are pricey and that could limit upsides.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

Musk has been a key player in the drama, boosting the price with a succession of tweets in recent months.\n\nThe so-called DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon is the first commercial lunar payload in history paid for entirely with Dogecoin, according to a statement from Geometric.

There was no immediate response to questions emailed after-hours.\n\nGeometric\u2019s website describes the firm as a private Canadian company originally founded to invent renewable energy technologies, and which has since expanded into areas like space.\n\n\u201cDOGE has proven to be a fast, reliable, and cryptographically secure digital currency that operates when traditional banks cannot and is sophisticated enough to finance a commercial Moon mission in full,\" Geometric said in the statement. \u201cIt has been chosen as the unit of account for all lunar business between SpaceX and Geometric Energy Corporation and sets precedent for future missions to the Moon and Mars.\"\n\nMark Cuban, Snoop Dogg and Gene Simmons are among the other celebrities who have boosted Dogecoin. At the same time, warnings abound that its rally is unsustainable and that buyers could lose all their money.\n\nThe phrase \u201cto the Moon\" is often used to express the hope that an asset\u2019s price will continue to rise, and Musk employed the term in a Twitter post referring to the lunar deal.

    "Text": "That is not the worst part of the quarterly earnings. What went behind this profit miss are a huge chunk of interest reversal due to bad loans and the incremental need of setting aside large provisions. Bandhan Bank carved Rs1,594 crore out of its earnings to set aside as provisions for the quarter, 49% higher sequentially. The lender\u2019s core income grew by a mere 4.6% and much of the support to profits came from other income. Needless to say, most brokerages have downgraded the company. \u201cOur detailed analysis of its loan-book shows that over the next 4-6 qtrs, it will need to provide Rs3,000 crore-Rs3,500 crore (3.5-4% of loans) towards credit risks/ provision lift-up,\" wrote analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a note.\n\nIn essence, all trouble for the lender emerged from asset quality. As such, gross bad loans remain elevated, at 6.8% of total loan book, and the outlook, too, is far from sanguine. What surprised investors is the Rs1,930 crore worth of loans written off during the quarter. The lender said that this is towards strengthening the balance sheet and these write-offs are technical. Even so, written off accounts are typically the weakest of the stressed lot and recoveries from such accounts is minimal. Overall stress increased sharply. Bandhan Bank\u2019s troubles are centred on two states that form a large part of its business, West Bengal and Assam. Analysts had anticipated weakness from Assam given a new law that caps the amount of loan an individual can borrow. However, most were expecting Bandhan Bank to come out largely unscathed from the political uncertainty due to elections. The argument has been that the lender has weathered many elections in the past.\n\nBut elections didn\u2019t come alone, they came with a pandemic. Ergo, along with the general reluctance to honour repayments during an election, the economic impact of the second wave, too, began to manifest. Collection efficiency dropped to 83% in the March quarter from 88% the previous quarter for Assam. \u201cWith loan portfolio in key states such as West Bengal and Assam facing challenges due to multiple reasons and clarity on law change awaited, near-term outlook on overall asset quality is uncertain,\" wrote analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd in a note.\n\nShares of the bank have underperformed the sector index since April, a reflection of the concerns over asset quality in the wake of elections and the second wave. However, with fourth quarter metrics disappointing and outlook rather weak, Bandhan Bank\u2019s stock may continue to be under pressure beyond today\u2019s 10% drop in early trade.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "MUMBAI : Sharply compressing margins take away the comfort generated by robust volumes growth for Kansai Nerolac\u2019s investors. The shares of the company fell nearly 2% on NSE in Monday's opening trade.\n\nIn the March quarter, the company's decorative and industrial paints segments grew in high double-digits. Largely aided by a low base and demand from smaller cities and towns, paint makers were expected to see robust sales growth for the third consecutive quarter in March. Sales recovery in the automobile and consumer durables sectors has helped Kansai's industrial paints segment to make a comeback, analysts said. The company gets around 55% of its overall revenue from the decorative paints business and the remainder from industrial paints. Although near-term demand across segments is being impacted by the second wave of the pandemic, the company's management is optimistic of revival in demand going forward.\n\nKansai's gross margin contracted sharply by 440 basis points year-on-year to 34.6% hit by elevated input costs. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Prices of titanium dioxide and other crude-based monomers have risen by more than 20% in the past year. Analysts at Nomura Inc. point out that the inflationary trend will likely continue to impact the company's gross margins over H1FY22 even as Kansai is yet to fully exhaust lower-cost raw material inventory from Q2FY21.\n\nThe recent price hikes of around 1.5-2% are not enough to mitigate the impact of inflation on margins, said analysts. However, the company's management has said that it would raise prices further. As for operating margin, even though the fall in Ebitda was curtailed by a decline in employee costs and other expenses, against the backdrop of cost inflation, it hardly brings cheer, analysts said. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, Ebitda margins expanded by 220bps year-on-yein the March quarter.\n\nBloomberg data shows that shares of the company trade at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 43 times. This is lower than peers Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints, which trade at PE multiples of around 75-80 times.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

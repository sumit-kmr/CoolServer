    "Text": "Republicans and business groups have blasted Mr. Biden\u2019s plans to fund new spending on roads, bridges, low-carbon energy deployment, child care, education and a host of other initiatives by raising taxes on corporations, high earners and the wealthy. Mr. Biden has responded by amplifying his arguments: In recent remarks, he has focused almost as much on the tax increases as he has on the programs they would pay for.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s comments reflect both a read of public polling and a negotiating tactic. He is presenting the tax increases not simply as a method of paying for his sprawling agenda, but as a policy goal on their own, aimed at narrowing gaps in income and wealth that have been exposed in stark terms by the coronavirus pandemic. He and his aides see a chance to turn the issue against Republicans who have long preached tax cuts and hammered Democrats for supporting any tax increases.\n\nA wide range of polls now show broad public support for tax increases on high earners. A Pew Research poll last week found that Americans were much more likely to be upset that the wealthy and corporations did not pay \u201ctheir fair share\u201d in taxes than to be upset about the size of their own tax bills.\n\n\u201cOn taxes, Biden has flipped the script on Republicans,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago who worked in the Obama and Clinton administrations and is in line for an ambassadorship under Mr. Biden. \u201cEspecially since the Biden tax plan is popular with the G.O.P. base. Biden knows this and is taunting them head on.\u201d\n\nRepublicans in Congress continue to warn that Mr. Biden\u2019s tax increases could cripple an economy that is just beginning to recover from the pandemic downturn and hurt workers, even though the president has vowed not to raise taxes on individuals or households earning less than $400,000. They say that corporate tax increases will hurt business investment and growth, and that companies will pass some of those increases on to their workers in the form of lower wages.",

The SFBs would be able to deploy these funds for fresh lending of up to \u20b910 lakh per borrower. This facility would be available till October 31.\n\nIn view of the fresh challenges brought on by the pandemic and to address the emergent liquidity position of smaller MFIs, SFBs are now being permitted to reckon fresh lending to smaller MFIs (with asset size of up to \u20b9500 crore) for onlending to individual borrowers as priority sector lending. This facility will be available up to March 31, 2022.\n\nState governments\n\nTo enable the State governments to better manage their fiscal situation in terms of their cash flows and market borrowings, maximum number of days of overdraft (OD) in a quarter is being increased from 36 to 50 days and the number of consecutive days of OD from 14 to 21 days, the RBI said.\n\nSeparately, Mr, Das asserted that though the impact of the second wave was \u2018debilitating\u2019, it was \u2018not insurmountable\u2019. \u201cWe do not expect any broad deviations in our projections,\u201d he added.",

We are committed to go unconventional and devise new responses as and when the situation demands,\" Das said in an unscheduled address amid the sharp surge in Covid cases.\"We must also stay focused on our future, which appears bright even at this juncture, with India set to emerge as one of the fastest growing economies in the world,\" the RBI governor said, emphasising that the growth prospects remained strong despite the ravaging impact of the virus.He said the immediate objective was to preserve human life and restore livelihoods through all means possible. \"The second wave, though debilitating, is not unsurmountable. It is during our darkest moments that we must focus on the light. We have lessons to draw from our experience of last year, when as a nation we came together and overcame the once-in-a-generation challenge imposed by the first wave of the pandemic,\" Das said as he unveiled measures to provide relief and financing for the healthcare sector.\"We must remain resolutely focused on a post-pandemic future of strong and sustainable growth with macroeconomic and financial stability. I call upon all stakeholders to come forward once again to address the challenges posed by the current wave of the pandemic, while remaining on guard against future waves,\" said Das.He said aggregate demand conditions, particularly in contact-intensive services, are likely to see a temporary dip, depending on how the Covid situation unfolds. With restrictions and containment measures being localised and targeted, businesses and households are learning to adapt, said Das.The RBI governor said a normal south-west monsoon, as forecast by the IMD, should help to contain food price pressures, especially in cereals and pulses. The build-up in input price pressures across sectors, driven in part by elevated global commodity prices, remains a concern.",

    "Text": "Hyderabad/Mumbai: In the first instance of a pharma company taking the compulsory licensing (CL) route to launch a Covid drug in India, Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma has filed for a waiver of patent rights to manufacture rheumatoid arthritis drug Baricitinib. The CL, if granted, will help in improving the accessibility and affordability of the drug, bringing its price down substantially.The USFDA had last November granted emergency authorisation for Baricitinib in combination with Remdesivir.At present, a limited quantity of the patented drug is available in the country, and that too, at an exorbitant price (see graphic). The patent is held by Incyte Holdings, with a licence to Eli Lilly, which markets the drug under the Olumiant brand name. The application has been filed under Section 92 of the Patents Act, which can be invoked by the Centre due to a national emergency, circumstances of extreme urgency or in case of public non-commercial use.In its application, Natco has cited the unmet medical needs due to the lack of supply and affordability in light of the grave and life-threatening national public health emergency caused by the second Covid wave as the main grounds for seeking the CL. Under the World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement, CLs are legally recognised means to overcome barriers in accessing affordable medicines. Under the rules, governments allow a company to manufacture a patented drug without the consent of the innovator firm. In 2012, Natco became the first company to get a compulsory licence in India, which was related to a cancer drug called Nexavar. While there have been attempts to invoke the provisions again, the government has resisted regular use of the clause.Natco\u2019s move is, however, expected to force the government to examine the application carefully given that former PM Manmohan Singh had pointed to the flexibility available under the law, although his reference was in the context of ramping up vaccination. The application puts pressure on the US drug maker, analysts said. It has only two choices \u2014 either give a voluntary licence or sue Natco for the patent, which could result in a public backlash given the soaring Covid case load and death toll in India.Natco has applied for a CL at a time when India and South Africa have approached the WTO for a temporary suspension of intellectual property rights of pharma companies so that Covid vaccines and other medicines can be accessible to poor countries. \u201cIt\u2019s time India set up an independent committee of experts to consider and advice on compulsory licensing and use of other safeguards for Covid medical products, including medicines and vaccines,\u201d lawyer and IP expert Leena Menghaney told TOI.In its application, Natco has urged the Controller General of Patents to grant it a CL to manufacture and market Baricitinib, both as bulk API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) and finished dosage only for Covid treatment in India till the pandemic prevails. It is also willing to pay a 7% royalty on net profits from Baricitinib sales to the patent-holder.Making its case, Natco\u2019s application said Olumiant is not manufactured in India \u2014 less than 9,000 tablets were imported in 2019 and 2020, at an average cost of Rs 3,230 per tablet. Citing the pricing as a significant barrier, it said a 14-day regimen (one tablet a day) works out to approximately Rs 45,220 per patient, which most Indians can ill-afford.Natco said it would structure its pricing at Rs 30 each for a 4mg tablet, which translates to Rs 420 for a 14-day course, Rs 20 for a 2mg tablet (Rs 280 for the regimen) and Rs 15 for each 1mg tablet, costing only Rs 210 for the entire 14-day therapy.It also pointed out that the drug\u2019s limited imports, which dropped from 8,870 tablets in 2019 to 8,385 tablets in 2020, would not be enough to cater the nearly 34 lakh Covid patients in India. \u201cThe tablets of Olumiant imported through 2020 by Lilly would serve at best to meet the needs of only approximately 600 patients,\u201d Natco said in its application, a copy of which was reviewed by TOI.Why the drug mattersBaricitinib is a rheumatoid arthritis drug used in combination with Remdesivir for Covid treatment in some countries. The US Food and Drug Authority granted emergency use authorisation for Baricitinib in November 2020. The drug prevents a cytokine storm and calms down the immune system by inhibiting Janus Kinases (enzymes) that send signals to the cells to make more cytokines. The use of Baricitinib with Remdesivir reduces hospital time, increases chances of survival and also has minimal associated adverse events.",

    "Text": "Mumbai: Given the rising anxiety levels among employees, several organisations are revealing their compassionate side by offering staff a much-needed break from work. Godrej Properties has closed offices for the week, starting Wednesday. Goldman Sachs has declared this Friday as a \u2018self-care day\u2019, encouraging employees to take the day off. RepIndia on Wednesday announced a 4-day mental health break for its staff. The Delhi- and Mumbai-based agency has decided to shut shop from May 6 to May 9 \u201cto afford employees the requisite time for healing, being with their loved ones and get vaccinated\u201d.The offices of philanthropic firm Dasra, on the other hand, have been closed for two weeks since April 26, for a \u201c14-day work quarantine\u201d. Employees have been asked to pause their immediate work deliverables and rather focus on caring for self, family and communities.Over the last few weeks, several other companies have announced mental health breaks and vaccination & Covid leaves to help employees navigate a rough patch. In an internal note to all India employees, Goldman Sachs shared, \u201cMany of us have been affected directly or indirectly by the pandemic . We acknowledge it has put a lot of strain on our people physically and mentally, and encourage you to prioritise your health and wellbeing, and that of your families, above all else. To support you, this Friday, May 7 will be a \u2018self-care day\u2019 for colleagues in India.\u201d\u201cWe also recognise that many of you are supporting family, friends or your communities during this time. To help you manage these priorities, we are also providing a \u2018Care for Others Day\u2019 off for our people in India, to be used before the end of June,\u201d the firm said in the note.Godrej Properties MD & CEO Mohit Malhotra said, \u201cThe work-from-home burnout is real and the last 13 months of Covid and the second wave have taken a toll on people, emotionally and mentally. As a company it is our responsibility to be with our employees and we understand that in tough times like these, everyone deserves a break. We introduced \u2018Taking a Pause to Heal\u2019 initiative where these three days starting May 5 plus the weekend will be a complete break from everything work-related.\u201d This is applicable to close to 2,000 permanent employees and approximately 600 contract employees working across all locations of Godrej Properties in India. \u201cWe have also proactively given a heads-up to our customers so that the sales and customer centricity teams can take a break too,\u201d said Malhotra.Dasra\u2019s associate director of talent management and internal operations, Ninad Ankleshwaria, said, \u201cOur staff members have been volunteering to raise funds and as an emergency response team to fulfil urgent needs of Covid-affected people. We realised that many of our employees were distressed due to Covid affecting themselves, their loved ones or the community at large. Thus, we acknowledge that in such dark times, it\u2019s essential to go beyond the words of being a people-first organisation and ensure that awe prioritise caring actions towards each and everyone\u2019s well-being.\u201dIn a statement, RepIndia CEO Archit Chenoy said, \u201cThere is no denying that this is an incredibly difficult time for the entire nation \u2014 and our workforce is no exception to that reality. We\u2019ve all been knocked off our feet, witnessing the devastation all around us. This is a small initiative we\u2019ve taken to give our people breathing room \u2014 whether that\u2019s used to grieve, to recuperate or to get vaccinated. The hard truth is that we\u2019re in a full-blown national crisis and if giving people a few days off is going to ease a tiny bit of that pressure, it\u2019s frankly the least we can do. I hope employers across the nation are supportive towards their teams who have worked relentlessly during the pandemic and at this time do not shy away from showing compassion and basic human decency.\u201d",

    "Text": "Fox News Profits Grow Even as Viewership Declines This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of markets, business and the economy.\n\nFox News keeps profits flowing at Murdoch\u2019s Fox Corporation. Lachlan Murdoch, Fox Corporation\u2019s chief executive, claimed victory as Fox News \u201creclaimed its leadership position as America\u2019s No. 1 cable news network.\u201d Credit... Mike Cohen for The New York Times Fox News, the cable news giant controlled by Rupert Murdoch, kept its parent company flush in the first three months of the year, notching a slight gain in profit and sales despite a drop in viewers. Altogether, Fox Corporation beat Wall Street expectations with a sevenfold increase in profit to $567 million and a 6.5 percent drop in revenue to $3.2 billion compared with the same period a year prior. A change in how the company valued some of its assets was a key reason for the profit surge. Investors were looking for a $332 million profit and $3.1 billion in sales. But revenue at most of its businesses dropped as fewer viewers tuned into the company\u2019s cable channels and the Fox broadcast network, in part because Fox did not host the Super Bowl this year. Total advertising sales fell 24 percent to $1.2 billion, with the cable segment, primarily Fox News, seeing ad revenue drop 7 percent to $283 million. The decrease in advertising mirrors the performance at other media conglomerates and spotlights a significant shift in the advertising market. Ad revenue jumped at Facebook, Google and even smaller digital publishers in the first quarter as advertisers were more willing to spend their budget on digital platforms, often at the expense of television. Fox News still makes up the vast majority of Fox Corporation\u2019s profits. The cable division that houses the news network generated $899 million in pretax income, accounting for 95 percent of the company\u2019s total pretax profit. The company\u2019s businesses include several sports cable networks and the free streaming platform Tubi. The company also announced on Wednesday the acquisition of OutKick Media, the publisher of its namesake sports news site. The company is run by Clay Travis, a sports commentator who has been known for making controversial statements. Last year, he called the coronavirus \u201coverrated\u201d and downplayed the severity of the brewing pandemic. In a statement announcing the acquisition, Lachlan Murdoch, chief executive of Fox Corporation and the son of Rupert Murdoch, welcomed Mr. Travis. \u201cClay and his team have quickly made OutKick a content powerhouse with a very large, loyal and engaged audience.\u201d Despite the drop in viewers at Fox News, the network benefited from contractually triggered rate increases that cable operators pay to carry the channel. Licensing fees rose 6 percent to $1.07 billion. Advertising fell despite charging higher ad rates. The younger Mr. Murdoch claimed victory for Fox News in a call with investors after the earnings report. \u201cFox News reclaimed its leadership position as America\u2019s No. 1 cable news network and the most-watched cable network in prime time,\u201d he said before taking a moment to take a jab at rivals. \u201cMSNBC lost more than one-third of its audience and CNN lost over half,\u201d he said. \u201cOver half.\u201d\n\nUber shows signs of recovery from the pandemic slowdown. Although it is recovering, Uber is still losing money. Credit... Teresa Eng for The New York Times Uber said its business was recovering from the slowdown caused by the pandemic, although it continued to lose money. The company said on Wednesday that revenue was $2.9 billion in the first three months of the year, down 11 percent from the same period a year ago. The decline in earnings included $600 million that Uber has earmarked to pay for settlements with drivers in Britain, where the Supreme Court ruled in February that drivers should be classified as workers and be entitled to a minimum wage and vacation time. Excluding the settlement fund, Uber\u2019s revenue was $3.5 billion, an 8 percent increase from the previous year that outpaced Wall Street expectations of $3.28 billion. Uber lost $108 million, an improvement from the previous year, when it lost $2.9 billion. Uber attributed the change to the sale of its autonomous vehicle unit, which was acquired by the self-driving truck start-up Aurora in December. Uber\u2019s operating loss for the quarter was $1.5 billion \u2014 also made worse by the British driver settlement. On Tuesday, Uber\u2019s primary competitor in the United States, Lyft, said that it was also recovering from the slowdown caused by the pandemic as riders began to return to the platform. Still, Lyft\u2019s revenue for the quarter was $609 million, a 36 percent decline from the previous year. Losses were $427.3 million, 7 percent more than its losses the previous year. \u201cUber is starting to fire on all cylinders, as more consumers are riding with us again while continuing to use our expanding delivery offerings,\u201d Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. Uber\u2019s stock price dropped more than 4 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday evening. While consumers have avoided travel over the past year, Uber\u2019s business has been bolstered by its food delivery service, Uber Eats. Revenue from delivery was $1.7 billion, a 270 percent increase from a year ago. Despite reopenings in Sydney and New York City, Uber said that customers have continued to order food delivery at a strong pace. But while riders have started returning to Uber and Lyft, drivers have been more hesitant. Both companies said they have faced driver shortages. During a call on Tuesday with financial analysts, Lyft\u2019s president, John Zimmer, said he expected drivers who saw food delivery as a safer option during the pandemic would return to ride hailing because the pay is better and because drivers miss social interactions with riders. Uber said it had 3.5 million active drivers and couriers during the first three months of the year, down 22 percent from the previous year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTreasury urges Congress to lift the debt limit as government spending surges. The Treasury Department on Wednesday called on Congress to address a looming cap on the amount of debt the government can issue, warning that a surge of expenditures related pandemic could render its traditional tools for keeping the nation from breaching the debt limit less effective. A divided Congress passed a two-year budget deal in 2019 that suspended the so-called debt ceiling until July 31. The agreement, which was made before the pandemic struck, was intended to put off budget battles and give clarity over spending going into a presidential election year. Now, the Biden administration and a Congress controlled by Democrats must make sure the government can continue borrowing to pay its bills. \u201cIf Congress has not acted by July 31, Treasury, as it has in the past, may take certain extraordinary measures to continue to finance the government on a temporary basis,\u201d said Brian Smith, Treasury\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for federal finance. \u201cIn light of the substantial Covid-related uncertainty about receipts and outlays in the coming months, it is very difficult to predict how long extraordinary measures might last.\u201d Negotiations over raising or suspending the debt limit are often fraught, and Treasury has developed tools over the years to give the federal government more flexibility as the deadline approaches. Those \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d include suspending sales of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities and suspending reinvestment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Treasury can also redeem existing investments of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund and suspend reinvestment of the Government Securities Investment Fund. In the past, those measures have allowed the Treasury Department to extend the debt limit deadline on its own for months. But Mr. Smith said Treasury was studying potential scenarios \u201cin which extraordinary measures could be exhausted much more quickly than in prior debt limit episodes.\u201d Asked in a press briefing if Treasury was considering prioritizing payments if the deadline is missed, Mr. Smith said: \u201cCongress needs to raise or suspend the debt limit, that\u2019s the way to resolve this issue.\u201d The debt limit warning came as part of the Treasury Department\u2019s quarterly announcement about its financing plans. Treasury said this week that it expects to borrow more than $1 trillion during the rest of the fiscal year as the United States continues spending heavily to combat the coronavirus crisis.\n\nLawmakers slam Facebook oversight board\u2019s decision to uphold Trump ban. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:48 - 0:00 transcript Facebook Oversight Board Upholds Ban of Trump A Facebook-appointed oversight board ruled to uphold the social network\u2019s ban of former President Donald J. Trump at a panel on Wednesday. Our decision this morning is relatively simple and straightforward. First, we agree that Facebook had sufficient justification to remove Mr. Trump\u2019s Jan. 6 posts for violation of the policy against praising or encouraging violent actors. Second, we agree that Facebook had sufficient justification to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account, at least for the duration of what the Department of Homeland Security called a, quote, \u201cheightened risk of violence.\u201d But we hold that it was improper, that is to say, in violation of Facebook\u2019s own rules, as well as generally accepted principles of freedom of expression, for Facebook to make that suspension indefinite. A Facebook-appointed oversight board ruled to uphold the social network\u2019s ban of former President Donald J. Trump at a panel on Wednesday. Credit Credit... Erin Schaff/The New York Times Lawmakers lashed out at the ruling by Facebook\u2019s oversight board on Wednesday to uphold the social network\u2019s ban on former President Donald J. Trump, at least for now. Driving the discontent was that the oversight board, a quasi-court that confers over some of Facebook\u2019s content decisions, did not make a black-and-white decision about the case. Mr. Trump had been blocked from the social network in January after his comments online and elsewhere incited the storming of the Capitol building. While the oversight board said on Wednesday that Facebook was justified in suspending Mr. Trump at the time because of the risk of further violence, it also said the company needed to revisit its action. The board said Facebook\u2019s move was \u201ca vague, standardless penalty\u201d without defined limits, which needed to be reviewed again for a final decision on Mr. Trump\u2019s account in six months. That angered both Republicans and Democrats. Republican lawmakers have pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s ouster by Facebook, Twitter and others as evidence of an alleged anti-conservative campaign by tech companies, calling the decisions a dangerous precedent for censorship of political figures. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, tweeted that the board\u2019s decision on Wednesday was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and warned it could have dangerous ripple effects. \u201cFor every liberal celebrating Trump\u2019s social media ban, if the Big Tech oligarchs can muzzle the former President, what\u2019s to stop them from silencing you?\u201d Mr. Cruz said in his tweet. Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said in a statement that the move showed that \u201cit\u2019s clear that Mark Zuckerberg views himself as the arbiter of free speech.\u201d Republican members of the House judiciary committee tweeted that the decision was \u201cpathetic,\u201d and Jim Jordan of Ohio, the ranking member, tweeted about Facebook: \u201cBreak them up.\u201d Democrats, also dissatisfied with the murky decision, took aim at how Facebook can be used to spread lies. Frank Pallone, the chairman of the House energy and commerce committee, tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump has played a big role in helping Facebook spread disinformation, but whether he\u2019s on the platform or not, Facebook and other social media platforms with the same business model will find ways to highlight divisive content to drive advertising revenues.\u201d Representative Ken Buck, Republican of Colorado and the ranking member of the House antitrust subcommittee, accused the oversight board of political bias. \u201cFacebook made an arbitrary decision based on its political preferences, and the Oversight Board, organized and funded by Facebook, reaffirmed its decision,\u201d he said. But scholars who support free speech welcomed the decision. They have warned that as social media companies become more active in determining what stays online and what doesn\u2019t, that could potentially lead to a slippery slope where tech giants have too much sway over digital speech. \u201cThe Facebook Oversight Board has said what many critics noted \u2014 the ban of former President Trump, while perhaps justified, was worrisome in its open-endedness and lack of process,\u201d said Gautam Hans, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cTo the degree that the decision draws attention to how ad hoc, manipulable, and arbitrary Facebook\u2019s own content policies get enforced, I welcome it.\u201d Mike Isaac contributed reporting.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA U.S. federal judge vacates the national freeze on evictions. Activists gathered outside Brooklyn Borough Hall on Monday to call for an extension of New York\u2019s moratorium on evictions. Credit... Justin Lane/EPA, via Shutterstock A federal judge on Wednesday struck down the nationwide moratorium on evictions imposed by the Trump administration last year and extended by President Biden until June 30, a ruling that could affect tenants struggling to pay rent during the pandemic. The decision, by Judge Dabney Friedrich of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, is the most significant federal ruling on the moratorium yet, and follows three similar federal court decisions. The Justice Department immediately appealed, and will seek an emergency stay of the decision, potentially delaying a final resolution of the case past the moratorium\u2019s planned June 30 expiration. It remains unclear how wide an impact the decision will have on renters. It does not necessarily bind state housing court judges, who rule on eviction orders, and two other federal courts have upheld the moratorium, adding to the confusion about its fate. \u201cThere are now numerous conflicting court rulings at the district court level, with several judges ruling in favor of the moratorium and several ruling against,\u201d said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a national tenants advocacy group. Still, tenants\u2019 rights groups said the decision on Wednesday could leave more low-income and working-class tenants vulnerable to eviction in coming weeks even as the Biden administration is beginning to disburse tens of billions of dollars in aid to help them catch up on unpaid rent. Landlords said the decision validated their arguments that the legal basis for the federal moratorium was unsound and overstepped the government\u2019s power. The case was brought in November by the Alabama Association of Realtors and a group of real estate agents in Georgia who claimed the moratorium shifted the burden for rent payments from the tenants to landlords at a time when many owners have been struggling to meet their own expenses. The moratorium has had a substantial effect. Despite the sharp economic downturn created by the pandemic, eviction filings declined 65 percent in 2020 over the usual annual rate, according to an analysis of court data by the nonprofit group Eviction Lab. Housing analysts warned that Wednesday\u2019s ruling could embolden more landlords to begin eviction proceedings against tenants before the federal government can disburse $45 billion in emergency housing assistance appropriated by Congress. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t come at a worse time,\u201d said Mary K. Cunningham, who studies housing with the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan policy group. \u201cThis is happening just as communities are trying to beat the clock, waiting for the federal government to get its new housing subsidies out the door before the moratorium expires on June 30. It\u2019s terrible news.\u201d Landlords and real estate agents downplayed concerns that lifting the moratorium will create an eviction crisis. \u201cWith rental assistance secured, the economy strengthening and unemployment rates falling, there is no need to continue a blanket, nationwide eviction ban,\u201d a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors said in a statement. The executive order covers any single renter making less than $99,000 a year and families making twice that much. About 8.2 million tenants reported that they had fallen behind in their rent payments during the pandemic, according to Census Bureau estimates. Federal decisions, like the one issued Wednesday, are significant but serve as guidance rather than an order \u2014 although an unequivocal ruling from a prominent federal court is likely to sway some local judges, said Eric Dunn, director of litigation for the National Housing Law Project, a tenant advocacy group.\n\nG.M. made $3 billion profit in the first quarter but expects a chip shortage to hurt business. At a General Motors assembly plant in Ontario. Credit... Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press A global shortage of computer chips that has forced automakers to idle plants in recent weeks is expected to take an even heavier toll on the industry in second quarter. General Motors said on Wednesday that it made a $3 billion profit in the first three months of the year, up from just $294 million a year earlier. But the company warned that its profit would be significantly smaller in the second quarter because of the shortage. \u201cEvery region of the world has been dealing with the supply-demand imbalance for semiconductors, and we\u2019ve been working through some significant disruptions to production,\u201d G.M.\u2019s chief executive, Mary Barra, said in a conference call with reporters. The company expects net income for the first half of the year to total about $3.5 billion, implying a profit of around $500 million in the second quarter. It said it expected a rebound in the second half of 2021 and predicted net income for the full year to range from $6.8 billion to $7.6 billion. The G.M. forecast comes a week after Ford Motor said the shortage would likely cut its output of cars and trucks in half in the second quarter of the year from its previously planned level. Separately, Stellantis, the company formed by the merger of Peugeot SA and Fiat Chrysler, said on Wednesday that its production in the first quarter was 11 percent lower than planned because of the chip shortage, and it also warned that the second quarter would be weaker than the first. Stellantis reported revenue of 34 billion euros ($41 billion) since the merger was completed on Jan. 17. Had the merger been completed earlier, the new company\u2019s revenue for the full first quarter would have been 37 billion euros, up 14 percent over the same period a year ago. Modern vehicles require dozens of computer chips for the electronics that control everything from brakes and transmissions to entertainment and navigation systems and tire-pressure monitors. Last year, as many automakers closed factories to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, sales of consumer electronics like laptops and game consoles took off, and semiconductor manufacturers shifted their production. Now, chip makers are struggling to meet demand to the type of chips used by automakers, which are seeing a strong rebound in demand for cars and trucks. Ms. Barra said G.M. was helped in the first quarter by directing the chips it did have to plants making its more profitable and top-selling models. \u201cA lot of really good work is being done across our company to source semiconductors, allocate them to our most in-demand, capacity-constrained products,\u201d she said. One positive from the shortage for automakers is that tight inventories of new vehicles has forced consumers to pay close to list prices for many models. G.M. said the average price paid for the vehicles it sold in North America in the first quarter was $3,500 higher than a year ago, lifting the company\u2019s profit in the region.\n\nDogecoin continues its scarcely believable surge. Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency that started as a joke, is on a tear. A surge in the past day pushed it to another record, sending it some 14,000 percent higher than it started the year. Year-to-date performance of cryptocurrency prices One theory is that the upcoming appearance of Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive and noted Dogecoin superfan, as the host of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d on May 8 could get more people interested in trading the crypto token. It\u2019s as good a reason as any for those who try to rationalize its movements. The latest bout of Dogecoin mania has somewhat overshadowed what\u2019s going on in Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which also set records this week and made its 27-year-old co-creator, Vitalik Buterin, a billionaire (in dollars). The price of Ether, the crypto token built on the Ethereum blockchain, is up more than 350 percent for the year to date, outpacing Bitcoin\u2019s relatively pedestrian 90 percent gain \u2014 which, for context, outpaces every stock in the S&P 500 over that period.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nEurope will tighten controls on Chinese firms as tensions rise. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner for trade. Efforts to approve an investment agreement between the European Union and China are on hold, he said. Credit... Pool photo by Yves Herman The European Union\u2019s administrative arm said Wednesday that it would take action against foreign companies that received financial support from their governments, a move clearly aimed at China amid signs of deteriorating ties. The tougher line against China comes only four months after Brussels and Beijing seemed to be moving closer, working out an agreement in December intended to make it easier for European companies to invest in what has become the bloc\u2019s most important trading partner for goods. But since then, relations have gone downhill because of tension over Chinese policy toward minority groups in the Xinjiang region. Legislation proposed by the European Commission on Wednesday would give it power to investigate and take measures against foreign companies that used government subsidies to get an unfair advantage over domestic competitors, an accusation often leveled at China. A separate proposal, also announced Wednesday, is intended to make Europe less dependent on China for crucial goods like semiconductors, drugs and batteries. A day earlier, Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner for trade, said work on making the December investment agreement with Beijing final was on hold because of repressive Chinese policies. In March, the European Commission issued sanctions against four Communist Party officials after accusing them of being responsible for human rights violations against members of the Muslim Uyghurs and other minority groups in Xinjiang. China retaliated with sanctions against numerous members of the European Parliament, several scholars, and employees of human rights organizations and think tanks that have been critical of China. In light of the sanctions war, Mr. Dombrovskis told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that \u201cit\u2019s clear the environment is not conducive for ratification of the agreement.\u201d This is what @VDombrovskis told @AFP on the ratification of #CAI with China - not first time he\u2019s said it & not breaking news.\n\n\n\nTo be clear: this is not a formal suspension decision, just means there\u2019s no political outreach right now to promote the agreement - see end of quote. pic.twitter.com/P1CgzkMu8e \u2014 Vanessa Mock (@vanessamock) May 4, 2021 Europe\u2019s tougher line toward China brings it closer to the stance adopted by the Biden administration, which objected to the investment agreement. But Europe remains divided over how to approach an important trading partner that is also a geopolitical rival. Markus J. Beyrer, director general of BusinessEurope, a leading business lobby, said in a statement Wednesday that the proposal on subsidies was \u201ca step in the right direction in addressing existing legal loopholes and preventing market distortions.\u201d But a prominent business group in Germany, which is highly dependent on exports to China, was critical. \u201cThe proposed regulation is very complex, and there is a risk that its implementation will lead to considerable additional bureaucracy and legal uncertainty for our member companies,\u201d said Ulrich Ackermann, managing director of foreign trade at V.D.M.A., which represents German makers of industrial equipment.",

However, they maintained that overall trend for gold price is bullish and any 3-4 per cent dip in the precious metal price should be seen as a buying opportunity.\n\nSpeaking on the gold price outlook Anuj Gupta, Vice President \u2014 Commodity & Currency Trade at IIFL Securities said, \"It will take time for the gold price to scale around its all-time high of \u20b956,191 at MCX. Currently, gold price in the international market is range-bound as it is oscillating in $1,770 to $1,800 per ounce levels. It has touched near $1,800 per ounce levels twice but failed to break the current resistance at around $1,800 to $1,805 mark.\"\n\nElaborating upon his gold price forecast in terms of MCX Anuj Gupta of IIFL Securities said, \"Gold price in the domestic market has immediate support at \u20b946,700 while it has resistance at \u20b947,500 per 10 gm levels. But, this is for the immediate short-term range. Overall the gold price outlook is positive. Any dip in the gold price should be seen as buying opportunity and one should avoid selling on rise as breakage of $1,800 resistance in the international market will lead to the next target of $1,820 per ounce that means at MCX we can see gold price hitting \u20b948,000 per 10 gm levels.\"\n\nAdvising gold investors to remain cautious about the current gold price range in the international market Amit Sajeja, Vice President \u2014 Research at Motilal Oswal said, \"Gold price in the international market has strong support in $1,735 to $1,750 range and it may go up to this range if the current support at $1,770 to $1,760 per ounce is broken. But, this dip should be seen as buying opportunity and one should accumulate on every 3-4 per cent dip in the gold price.\"\n\nSajeja said that gold price at MCX has strong support at \u20b946,550 to \u20b946,600 but on the breakage of this support it may go up to \u20b945,500 per 10 gm levels. He advised gold investors to keep accumulating on every dip as overall trend for the gold price is 'bullish.'\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

    "Text": "Rakesh Jhunjhunwala portfolio stocks are in news these days as the market magnet has overhauled its share holdings in 12 companies. While the Big Bull increased stake in 5 companies, he decided to lower stake in 7 companies. Stock market experts are of the opinion that this overhaul could have been caused by the reasons better known to Rakesh Jhunjhunwala only as they still see some of the Rakesh Jhunjhunwala stocks to go northward from current market price. Delta Corp is one such stock, to which the experts have given 'buy' tag and said that the stock is positive if an investor invests keeping log-term time-horizon in mind.\n\nSpeaking on the fundamentals of Delta Corp shares Avinaskh Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, \"Delta Corp has business in two sectors \u2014 online hotel booking and gaming. Its hotel booking business is hit due to the recent Covid-19 pandemic spread in India but at the same time the pandemic has helped its online gaming business.\" Gorakshkar said that once the Covid-19 crisis stablises one can expect the Delta Corp share price among the sharp upside moving stocks. However, he maintained that the stock is recommended for those who are investors and have long-term time-frame in mind.\n\nEye on third wave of Coronavirus\n\nOn what should be the ideal trade strategy if an investor decides to invest in Delta Corp shares Ravi Singhal, Vice Chairman at GCL Securities said, \"Delta Corp share price at NSE closed yesterday at \u20b9148.80. One can buy this counter at current market price for the long-term targets of \u20b9240 and \u20b9270 keeping stop loss at \u20b9124. However, I would advise investors to have an eye on how the third wave of Coronavirus pans out in India as the Government of India (GoI) has expected third wave of Covid-19 by November this year. If the GoI fails to contain the third wave, then the hospitality industry will have a huge hit in December, especially in Goa and Maharashtra.\"\n\nRavi Singhal of GCL Securities said that if the Indian government fails to contain the third wave of Covid-19, then it is advisable for the Delta Corp share holders to exit at \u20b9200 per stock levels and wait for the right time to re-enter.\n\nRakesh Jhunjhunwala net worth in Delta Corp Company\n\nAs per the Delta Corp shareholding pattern available at the BSE website bseindia.com, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and his wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala together hold 7.50 per cent company shares in March 2021 quarter, which means the investor duo didn\u2019t changed their holdings in Delta Corp Company.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

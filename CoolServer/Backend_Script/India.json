    "Text": "NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, on Sunday, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking an all-party meeting for a \u201ccollective and consensual\u201d approach to tackling the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWriting to the PM with six suggestions on ways to overcome the Covidcrisis, the leader of opposition echoed the views of party president Sonia Gandhi , former PM Manmohan Singh and MP Rahul Gandhi who have each written similar letters to the government in the last weeks and months, Kharge emphasised the need for an all-party meeting.\n\nHe also said that while most nations had planned in advance, prioritised their people and put in place contingencies for the anticipated second and third waves of the pandemic, such plans appeared to be missing in the Indian context.\n\n\u201cExperts have warned us that although the situation is dire, it can become far worse if leadership is not immediately exercised. So, for the well-being of our people and in the national interest, I urge you to consider the suggestions outlined in this letter sensitively and urgently,\u201d Kharge said.\n\nAmong key suggestions, Kharge said the government must use the Rs 35,000 crore amount allocated in the Union Budget for free mass vaccination, adding that allowing private companies to set exorbitant and differential prices for vaccines will adversely impact millions of Indians.\n\n\u201cSir, corporate profit cannot triumph saving lives. I, therefore, urge you to not relinquish the State's moral duty in immunising citizens. This is completely doable because India has a history of successful, large-scale immunisation programmes,\u201d he said.\n\nKharge also reiterated the Congress \u2019 demand to leverage compulsory licensing to increase the production of vaccines, waiver of GST on vaccines PPE kits, ambulances, ventilators, oxygen equipment and sanitisers.\n\nThe Congress MP said the government should also expedite distribution of relief material received from foreign countries with transparency on where it is shipped to, and to mitigate employment issued in rural areas where migrant workers have returned in large numbers, expand the man days under MGNREGS to ensure 200 days from the existing 100 days.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin EMail",

It must give a message of solidarity with the people, of serious business to alleviate their agony and of unity of purpose,\u201d he said, urging Naidu to take cognisance of the report of the Department Related Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare that had made vital recommendations on coping with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe meetings of the Standing Committees at this juncture will provide the nation much required collective initiative across the party lines. They are an effective instrument to ensure accountability, to provide an institutional platform to all stakeholders and to collectively explore solutions\u2026.It is in this spirit that I urge you to allow the virtual meetings of the Standing Committees,\u201d he said in his letter.\n\nTrinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien also wrote to Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla demanding virtual meetings of house panels.\n\n\u201cIndia has reported more than three lakh new Covid-19 cases per day for the past two weeks\u2026In light of the prevailing circumstances, I urge your good offices to reconsider our request for conducting virtual meetings of parliamentary committees, including departmentally related standing committees, consultative committees and select committees,\u201d he said.\n\nTMC also said it had sent three letters to the Lok Sabha Speaker in this regard, first in July 2020 and then again in August 2020.\n\nThe demand for virtual sittings of the two houses of Parliament, as was being done by several countries, and of standing committees, had been turned down by both Naidu and Birla earlier on grounds that virtual meetings would flout the confidentiality clause of such meetings and that any changes to the norms could only be ratified by Parliament.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin EMail",

    "Text": "GUWAHATI: The Cotton University \u2014 erstwhile Cotton College \u2014 fraternity was elated after receiving the news of their most popular student union leader from the late 1980s becoming the 15th chief minister of Assam .\n\nOne of the breeding grounds of future politicians, Cotton College produced six former chief ministers of Assam- Gopinath Bordoloi, Mahendra Mohan Choudhury, Sarat Chandra Singha, Jogendra Nath Hazarika, Hiteswar Saikia and Bhumidhar Barman- in the post-independence era. Despite the Cotton alumni playing an influential role across the political spectrum of the state all along, a Cottonian could not adorn the chief minister's chair in Assam since 1996. As Himanta Biswa Sarma is set to be sworn in as the new chief minister on Monday, both the alumni and students of the leading higher education institution have pinned high hopes from him, which is far broader than transforming the education scenario of the state.\n\n\u201cHe (Himanta) had a great zeal to work for students and society. At his initiative, Cotton College was announced as a Centre of Excellence. It was because of his efforts that Cotton College got transformed into a university. With sheer hard work, he came a long way to become a political stalwart of the northeast and the new CM is our very own CM,\u201d said Jagadish Dutta, general secretary of Cotton Alumni Association. He was hopeful that under Himanta\u2019s leadership, Assam will become one of the top-3 states of the country.\n\nHimanta drew severe criticism from the Cottonians, who took the lead in intensifying the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) when the legislation was passed in December 2019. However, many said they trusted Himanta\u2019s faith in Cotton University, despite differences on a range of political issues. Besides being a frontline leader of the All Assam Students\u2019 Union (Aasu), Himanta was a three-time general secretary of Cotton College Union Society (CCUS) in 1988-89, 1989-90 and 1991-1992.\n\nIncumbent general secretary of Cotton University Students\u2019 Union, Rahul Bordoloi, said on personal grounds, they never attacked Himanta. He, however, said on socio-political issues such as CAA, Cottonians will continue to remain firm on the stance. \u201cWe feel proud at Himanta Biswa Sarma\u2019s elevation to the chief minister\u2019s post. He is fond of his alma mater and we consider him as our guardian,\u201d said Bordoloi, a border of the Sitanath Brahma Choudhury Hostel of the university, where Himanta spent a significant period of his student life.\n\nThe general students, who could not come out to the streets to celebrate the occasion, were equally jubilant after the end of the week-long dilemma on the new CM of Assam. \"Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, a three-time general secretary of CCUS paved his way from being a popular student leader to 15th chief minister of Assam. How does he address the issue of CAA and also implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord is what we are looking for. As of now, we expect an eligible cabinet under his leadership that plans and works to tackle the pandemic that has affected our state,\" said Rahul Gupta, a postgraduate fourth-semester student of the state university .\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin EMail",

It is pertinent to note that the Central Government by nature of its large vaccination programme, places large purchase orders for vaccines as opposed to the state governments and/or private hospitals and therefore, this reality has some reflection in the prices negotiated.\"\n\n\"Thus, while it is ensured that the two vaccine manufacturers are not unduly enriched from out of public money, the citizens are not supposed to make any payment for getting both doses of the vaccine,\" the Centre said.\n\nHowever, it also said that the economics of the vaccine manufacturers must be borne in mind. \"Till date, there are only vaccines available from two vaccine manufacturers. Both manufacturers [one an Indian company and second a licensee of a British company] have taken the financial risk in developing and manufacturing these vaccines and it is prudent to make decisions on pricing through negotiations in a transparent consultative process keeping statutory provisions as a last resort under the present circumstances,\" it said.\n\nThe Union government said, \"To ensure that there is no disparity between the States inter-se, with active consultation of the Central Government with both the manufacturers, the Central Government has successfully fixed uniform prices to be paid by all the state governments.\"\n\n\"As per the policy, which is devised keeping the priority of maximum vaccine reach to the citizens depending upon their vulnerability in mind, ensuring equitable distribution of the quantity of vaccine to all states at a uniform rate, the possibility of vaccine pricing decision in India having an inevitable impact on the country\u2019s efforts bringing in more global vaccine manufacturers to India, the policy mandates 50% of the total manufactured quantity of vaccine from both manufacturers to be supplied to the Central Government. The logic behind this is to give priority in vaccination to the most vulnerable group of the population.\"\n\nExplaining the vaccine distribution formula, the Centre said, \"the remaining quantity to be uniformly distributed amongst all states on a pro-rata basis [viz. the total manufactured quantity from both the companies is divided and allocated to the States keeping in mind the total population of each State between the age group of 18- 44 years]. Out of the 50% quota allotted to each State, the division is made on a 50% - 50% basis. In other words, from out of the 50% allotted to the State, 50% will go to the State [calculated on a pro-rata basis based upon the population of the age group of 18-44 years] and the balance 50% will go to the private sector based upon the contracts between the private sector and vaccine manufacturers.\"\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin EMail",

He made a point to say that courts refused to remain a \u201cmute spectator\u201d to a national calamity, but it is \u201ctogether\u201d with the Centre to \u201chelp the Centre\u201d ease the pain of the people.\n\nA look at the Supreme Court orders show the Centre initially shifted the blame on the States for their lack of oxygen-lifting prowess and for making \u201cunrealistic\u201d demands for oxygen. All the while, the Centre had claimed that it had \u201cno dearth of oxygen\u201d.\n\nIn this regard, the court records in its April 30 order that \u201cthe Solicitor General has stated that there is no dearth of oxygen supply in the country as on date and steps are being taken continuously to augment the supply of oxygen.... Having said that, the Solicitor General has also admitted that there has been a shortage of supply to certain States and has attributed this shortage to various factors including the failure of State governments to lift the allocated quantity of oxygen from the supply point; transportation bottlenecks caused by inter-State movement of tankers; and technical failure of certain plants leading to reassessment of allocation on a real-time basis\u201d.\n\nNews Analysis | A paradigm shift in Supreme Court after Justice N.V. Ramana takes over as CJI\n\nThe hearings in the Supreme Court had also seen the Centre express its annoyance at the \u201cjudicial interference\u201d. When the Supreme Court had termed the Karnataka High Court\u2019s direction to the Centre on May 5 to allocate 1200 MT to the State, an exasperated Centre had reacted by offering to hand over its oxygen stock to the High Courts for distribution.\n\nHowever, by May 6, the Centre had toned down to admit in court that its \u201coxygen-for-bed\u201d formula needed a \u201cre-visit\u201d and there was an urgent requirement to form a national task force to devise an equitable way of allocation of oxygen.\n\nIn fact, the court, in its order on May 6, recounted the Centre\u2019s submission that \u201cthe formula on the basis of which oxygen is being allocated to the States and UTs is not static but needs to be re-visited\u201d.\n\nOn the formation of the National Task Force, the Centre had found such a move necessary \u201cto ensure that the allocation and distribution of oxygen takes place on a rational and equitable basis\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to constitute a National Task Force of experts which would determine the method of allocation and distribution of oxygen across States/UTs. Smaller expert committees or sub-groups may look into issues of auditing the manner in which supplies are to be distributed and utilised in each State/UT,\u201d the Supreme Court had recorded the Centre\u2019s submission. The Centre had wanted an \u201caudit\u201d of the distribution network.\n\nThe Supreme Court had thus merely ordered what the Centre itself wanted.",

In Delhi, petrol now comes for \u20b991.53 per litre and diesel is priced at \u20b982.06 per litre.\n\nWhile petrol prices had crossed the \u20b9100-mark in some places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh a few days back, Maharashtra's Parbhani joined the league on Monday. Petrol in Parbhani was priced at \u20b9100.20 a litre, while in Bhopal it came for\u20b9 99.55 a litre.\n\nThe fuel is sold at \u20b9102.42 a litre in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan and at \u20b9 102.12 in Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThis is the second time this year that rates in some parts have crossed the \u20b9100-a litre mark. Rates had breached the physiological mark for the first time in mid-February.\n\nFuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIn five increases in the last one week, petrol price has risen by \u20b91.14 per litre and diesel by \u20b91.33 \u2014 more than neutralising all of the reduction that came between March 24 and April 15.\n\nAfter raising petrol price by a record \u20b921.58 per litre and diesel by \u20b919.18 since the government raised excise duty to an all-time high in March last year, state-owned fuel retailers, IOC, BPCL and HPCL had reduced petrol price by 67 paise a litre and diesel by 74 paise per litre effected between March 24 and April 15.\n\nOil companies, who have in recent months resorted to unexplained freeze in rate revision, had hit a pause button after cutting prices marginally on April 15. This coincided with electioneering hitting peak to elect new governments in five states including West Bengal.\n\nNo sooner had voting ended, oil companies indicated an impending increase in retail prices in view of firming trends in international oil markets.\n\nThey said prices have been on a continuous uptrend since April 27, crude oil price is hovering near USD 70-per-barrel mark.\n\nCentral and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. The union government levies \u20b932.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and \u20b931.80 on diesel.\n\nIn Mumbai, the petrol price was hiked to \u20b997.86 a litre on Monday from \u20b997.61, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 89.17 from R\u20b988.82, the price notification showed.",

Mr. Yadav, who delivered the introductory speech, said that his father was \"unwell, his oxygen levels hovering around 85, a reason why Lalu ji will not speak much\".\n\nIt was not clear whether Mr. Prasad's oxygen levels were down because of some other problem or he had been infected by COVID-19.\n\nNonetheless, a wave of dejection swept over the party rank and file who were eagerly looking forward to hearing from their leader, famous for his flamboyant wisecracks and earthy sense of humour.\n\nMr. Prasad told the listeners party MLAs and those who had contested the assembly elections on RJD tickets but lost to rise to the occasion when the pandemic \"has reached our farthest villages\".\n\nThe listeners, who had been instructed to attend the \"virtual interaction\" from their respective constituencies via video conferencing, were asked to set up \"RJD COVID care centres\" in their areas of influence.\n\nThey were also urged to \"expose and thwart\" any instances of black marketing of oxygen cylinders and other important medicines, and help needy patients with food and other logistics like ambulances.\n\nMr. Prasad's maverick elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, who dotes on his father but has been overshadowed by his suave and shrewd younger sibling, also spoke on the occasion.\n\nHe proposed that in all the 243 assembly segments of the state, the party should run \"Lalu Rasoi\" (Lalu community kitchens) where food would be prepared and distributed free of cost.\n\nThe proposal, predictably met with applause, though it was not yet clear whether it was going to lead to fruition.\n\nMr. Prasad, who was the Chief Minister of undivided Bihar for seven straight years, first got convicted in a fodder scam case in 2013, which led to his disqualification from contesting elections.\n\nHe was, however, soon out on jail and took part in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in which his party came out with an unimpressive performance in the face of the \"Modi wave\".\n\nA year later, though, he emerged as the star attraction in the assembly polls which his party fought in alliance with arch rival and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JD(U).\n\nThough out of race himself, Mr. Prasad ensured through his electrifying campaign a spectacular comeback for the RJD that had been drubbed by the NDA in the 2010 Assembly polls, and both his sons made successful debuts, with Tejashwi becoming the deputy CM and Tej Pratap getting a cabinet berth.\n\nAlthough out of power now, the RJD once again emerged as the single largest party in the assembly elections held last year, which also saw the 32-year-old Tejashwi steering the party to an impressive performance despite the absence of his charismatic father.",

    "Text": "The recovery of 105-year-old Dhenu Chavan and his 95-year-old wife Motabai has become a ray of hope in ravaged Marathwada.\n\nThe third week of March proved to be Suresh Chavan\u2019s summer of disquiet: five members of his family including his wife and two children had tested positive for COVID-19. But he was especially disconcerted when his centenarian father Dhenu Chavan and his nonagenarian mother, Motabai contracted the virus and were suffering from high fever.\n\nAs the lethal second wave of the pandemic began engulfing rural Maharashtra, many in the village of Katgaon Krishna Tanda (around 18 km from Latur city) feared the end was near for their beloved and venerated residents \u2014 105-year-old Dhenu and 95-year-old Motabai.\n\n\u201cSeveral villagers advised me against taking them to a hospital. They kept saying no one returned once they went inside one\u2026 My 75-year-old elder brother was especially anxious. He was disturbed about not being able to perform our parents\u2019 last rites in the event of their passing away in the hospital\u2026 \u2018What if the authorities did not give the bodies back?\u2019 he kept saying,\u201d recalls Mr. Chavan,51, the youngest of eight siblings.\n\nSuresh Chavan, however, decided to take his parents to the civil hospital and accordingly admitted them to Latur\u2019s Vilasrao Deshmukh Government Institute of Medical Science.\n\nWhat happened over the next eight days has become the stuff of legend not only in Latur, but across much of Marathwada and neighbouring States as well.\n\n\u201cBeing ardent warkaris (devotees making the annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Lord Vithoba in Pandharpur), my parents naturally had great faith in God\u2026 While I tried to maintain a calm exterior, in my heart of hearts, I feared for their lives. But it was the fruit of their good deeds and their ardent faith which saw them defeat the malignant force of this virus,\u201d believes Mr. Chavan.\n\nWhether a strong immune system, good genes, or an unfashionable, yet unshakeable faith in divine providence, Dhenu Chavan and Motabai\u2019s triumph over Covid-19 is a rare shining light amid much heartbreak and loss in Maharashtra, which is still witnessing an average of 300 deaths daily.\n\n\u201cWhen they checked-in on March 24, both were in a critical condition\u2026but their eventual triumph is truly inspirational and astounding,\u201d says Dr. Sudhir Deshmukh, Dean of the Institute.\n\nDr. Gajanan Halkanche, who treated them, says early detection and diagnosis was key to the speedy recovery of the couple. Even then, he professes astonishment at their remarkably rapid recovery.\n\n\u201cGiven their respective ages, they had an alarming CT (computed tomography) score of 15/25. Both were administered the full course of Remdesivir for five days and were given high-flow oxygen (HFO). They began responding well to treatment after just two days. Ultimately, their immune systems were very strong and could cope with this kind of treatment. A lifelong regimen of hard-work and good habits held them in good stead,\u201d said Dr. Halkanche, speaking to The Hindu.\n\nDhenu Chavan has been working the fields for more than 65 years. According to Suresh Chavan, his father, a large-hearted man fundamentally generous by disposition, is affectionately known as \u2018Naik\u2019 in villages and taluks beyond Katgaon Tanda and Latur district.\n\nTo say Dhenu Chavan\u2019s long, rich life has been eventful would be an understatement.\n\n\u201cBoth my parents have witnessed cataclysmic natural events besides having been in the thick of historical and political upheavals. So, when they contracted COVID-19, their first reaction was that of insouciance\u2026they said they had seen off so many epidemics, earthquakes and pandemics, one more would scarcely make any difference,\u201d recalled Mr. Chavan.\n\nA child of two when the Spanish Flu exploded in India (known as Bombay Fever in Maharashtra), Dhenu Chavan has since witnessed the turmoil of Independence, the 1993 Latur earthquake, the subsequent plague of 1994, and the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic among other upheavals.\n\n\u201cAll their lives, my parents have believed in doing good for others. They urge the younger generation not to behave deceitfully towards anybody, but to help, be honest and develop a strong character. My father gave away portions of his big landholdings to tenants, donated land for public works. They ascribe their feat of beating the dreaded virus to the blessings and affection of the many people they have helped in the course of their lives. So much so, since the news broke, I have getting calls from people from districts all over Maharashtra and even from villages in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh,\u201d said Mr. Chavan.\n\nHe feels proud that his parents\u2019 triumph has sparked hope across Marathwada as well as the rural hinterland of Maharashtra, where people are now approaching the fight against the pandemic in a more positive frame of mind.",

Mr. Gangwar complained about officers not answering phone calls and patients being forced to visit multiple facilities before being admitted to a hospital.\n\nThe Environment Appraisal Committee (EAC) - Infrastructure I of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has flagged serious concerns about NITI Aayog\u2019s ambitious project for Great Nicobar Island (\u2018NITI Aayog vision for Great Nicobar ignores tribal, ecological concerns\u2019, The Hindu, March 21, 2021). The committee has, however, removed the first hurdle faced by the project. It has \u201crecommended\u201d it \u201cfor grant of terms of reference (TOR)\u201d for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies, which in the first instance will include baseline studies over three months.\n\nSome hospitals in Uttar Pradesh are consuming oxygen several times higher than the average, the State government said on Sunday based on the preliminary report of an oxygen audit conducted by it.\n\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on May 9 said GST exemption to domestic supplies and commercial import of COVID-19 drugs, vaccines and oxygen concentrators would make these items costlier for consumers as manufacturers would not be able to offset the taxes paid on inputs.\n\nRecurring waves of coronavirus infections are inevitable if existing practices such as expanding India's vaccination drive and following COVID protocol are not adhered to, say experts. Earlier last week, Principal Scientific Advisor K. VijayRaghavan had said, \u201cA phase three is inevitable, given the higher levels of circulating virus.\u201d\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to immediately convene an all-party meeting to \u201ccollectively forge a holistic blueprint to tackle the COVID pandemic\u201d.\n\nA first batch of oxygen concentrators and ventilators donated by the Red Cross Society of China arrived on Sunday on a cargo flight from China. The consignment marks among the biggest donations of medical supplies so far from China, from where India has been purchasing a huge amount of supplies, including oxygen concentrators.\n\nWest Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday said he has accorded sanction to a Central investigating agency for \u201cprosecuting Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra & Sovan Chatterjee as they were Ministers and he was their appointing authority.\n\nWest Bengal on Sunday registered a record 19,436 new cases of COVID-19 infections, while the number of samples tested for COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours was 63,095. There has been a rise in the number of cases and deaths since the second wave of COVID-19 hit West Bengal, which has recently witnessed a high-pitched election.\n\nBCCI president says India has a hectic schedule and there are lots of organisational hazards like 14-day quarantine which is tough to handle.\n\nAlexander Zverev continued his impressive form going into the French Open by winning his second Madrid Open title on Sunday.

    "Text": "The American public health expert also stressed on the importance of a lockdown to break the chain of transmission.\n\nGetting people vaccinated is the only long-term solution to the current COVID-19 crisis in India, America's top public health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Sunday as he called for scaling up manufacturing of coronavirus vaccines both domestically and globally to fight the deadly pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe endgame of this all...is going to be to get people vaccinated...India is the largest vaccine-producing country in the world. They've got to get their resources, not only from within, but also from without,\u201d Mr. Fauci, who is the Chief Medical Adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden, told ABC News in an interview.\n\n\u201cThat's the reason why other countries need to chip in to be able to get either supplies to the Indians to make their own vaccines or to get vaccines donated. One of the ways to do that is to have the big companies that have the capability of making vaccines to really scale up in a great way to get literally hundreds of millions of doses to be able to get to them,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding to a question, Dr. Fauci said that India needs to immediately build makeshift field hospitals like what China did a year ago.\n\n\u201cYou've got to get that. You can't have people out in the street not having a hospital bed. The oxygen situation is something that was really critical. I mean, to have people not have oxygen is really tragic, what's going on over there,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 80-year-old physician and immunologist, who serves as the director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said there is an immediate problem of hospital beds, oxygen, PPE and other supplies.\n\nShut down to break the chain of transmission\n\n\u201cThen there's the problem of looking forward to how are you going to shut this down, how are you going to turn it around, how are you going to break the chain of transmission?\u201d he said, underlining the need for a countrywide lockdown to arrest the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cVaccines is one of them but there are other ways too, like shutting down the government. I have advised them in the past that you really need to do that. You've got to shut down. I believe several of the Indian States have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission. And one of the ways to do that is to shut down,\u201d the top American doctor said.\n\nMr. Fauci, in an exclusive interview to PTI last week, had termed the situation in India \u201cvery desperate\u201d and suggested that the government marshal all its resources, including the armed forces, to immediately build makeshift field hospitals, and urged other countries to help with not only materials but also personnel.\n\nHe called for a nationwide lockdown, not necessarily for six months but \u201cfor a few weeks\u201d to break the \u201ccontinuity and transmission of infection.\u201d He also recommended mass vaccination to arrest the current spread of the deadly disease across India.\n\nIndia is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 4,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days.\n\nChina reported the first COVID-19 case in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and since then the deadly disease has become a pandemic, affecting more than 157,789,300 people and over 3,285,200 deaths worldwide.",

Veerapandian has come up with the idea of organising \u2018kala jathas\u2019 by engaging a group of PPE kit-clad artistes to cheer up the COVID-19 patients at the COVID Care Centres in the evenings.\n\nAnd the results are encouraging with one patient, after his discharge, writing a feedback in the social media about the positive impact of the initiative of the district administration.\n\n\u2018Kala jathas\u2019 are organised at the CCCs at Adoni, Yemmiganur, and Nandyal as well.\n\nAs soon as the artistes arrive, all the patients gather to enjoy their performance. The artistes lace the songs with the mandatory awareness messages on COVID-19, the ways of protecting oneself, and what should be the diet after being discharged so that the nutrition requirements are taken care of.\n\nThe patient, identified as Sunny, has likened the COVID Care Centre to nothing less than a five-star hotel. He has even posted photographs of the games played, the hygienic conditions, and the performance of the \u2018kala jatha\u2019 artistes.\n\n\u201cA regular visit by the doctors and their immediate response in case of necessity is being liked by many. The quality food being served three times a day has won the hearts of the patients,\u201d he points out.\n\nThe District Collector has thanked the officers for taking care of the patients with dedication. The positive feedback on the social media platforms vouches for it, he opines.\n\nThe administration has kept aside \u20b94.5 lakh for organising the \u2018kala jathas\u2019, and the artistes have been given advance.\n\nThe District Tourism Officer has been made in-charge of promoting these activities, which help the patients engage themselves in singing, playing games, an doing yoga or exercises.",

    "Text": "A few private hospitals have already started vaccinating people in the 18-44 age group\n\nKarnataka was among the first States to announce free vaccination for citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 at government centres. But with its start getting delayed, some private hospitals went ahead and started inoculating those in this age group. However, a few days down the line, allegations are emerging of some of them charging above the price fixed by the government.\n\nSources in the office of Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar confirmed that the price fixed for private hospitals was \u20b9600 plus service charge of \u20b9100 for Covishield, and \u20b91,200 plus service charge of \u20b9100 for Covaxin.\n\nHowever, when contacted, the administration of one of the hospitals said they were charging \u20b91,350 for Covaxin. The official did not comment further. Those who got the jab or are planning to were irked by the prices being quoted. Giridhur Sriraman, 26, who got vaccinated a few days ago, said, \u201cI paid \u20b91,350 for Covaxin. I think it is steep. I was lucky to be able to afford it,\u201d he said.\n\nAditya Ram, 29, is still searching for slots. \u201cI was shocked to see the prices at private hospitals. A few hospitals are charging \u20b9850 for Covishield, others \u20b91,350 and \u20b91,500 for Covaxin. For two doses, people are going to end up paying too much. Initially, I paid \u20b9250 each for my parents to get vaccinated at a private hospital. For the second dose, I booked a slot at ESI hospital as the cost of the vaccines were \u20b9850,\u201d he said, adding that he would prefer going to a government hospital now, though finding appointments may be difficult.\n\nThose who were trying to register after the State government\u2019s announcement of vaccination for the age group at select government hospitals beginning on Monday, were left disappointed. \u201cI live in Nagarabhavi and there are no government hospitals close by. No slots were showing in K.C. General, which is the next best option. When I checked private hospitals that are providing vaccination for my age group, there were no uniform rates even among the same hospital chain. For instance, one hospital was charging \u20b91,350 for Covaxin. In another branch of the same chain, it was \u20b91,000,\u201d said Ganesh, 38.\n\nSmall hospitals\n\nSmaller hospitals also expressed difficulty in being able to afford procurement of the doses. A doctor, on condition of anonymity, said, \u201cWe are not even getting enough doses for the second dose of the 45 plus age group. One of the companies manufacturing the vaccine told us we need to buy minimum 5,000 doses at \u20b91,200 per dose. How many small hospitals can afford this? Only the big hospitals will be able to.\u201d",

    "Text": "NEW DELHI: Not practising what he preached to citizens through judicial orders extracted a heavy price from a high court Judge, who himself and family members got infected by a coronavirus.The turn of events concerns an Orissa high court Judge, who as part of a bench had last year passed several orders directing the authorities how to enforce lockdown to minimise movement of people and prevent the rapid spread of Covid disease in the state.In one of the orders, the bench had said, \"We expect and hope that the government in its appropriate department shall bring out composite planning on availability of such essential items locally thereby requiring no use of two-wheelers (by the public to go out for the purchase of essential items) at the earliest.\"A year down the line, he forgot what he had said in his judicial orders about maintenance of social distancing and embarked on a pilgrimage with his 90-year-old mother, wife, brother and his wife in April when the exponential surge in Covid cases had begun, HC sources told TOI.The first destination was Allahabad, where they submerged at Sangam the ashes of his father, who had died last year. From there they proceeded to Haridwar , to take a holy dip in the Ganga river during the Kumbh, where a sea of humanity participated and many blamed it as an event that fuelled the rapid spread of the Covid disease.From Haridwar, the Judge and his family members proceeded to Gaya for certain religious rituals and then reached Puri on April 15. On returning to Cuttack, all family members tested positive for Covid. They recovered but the Judge's old mother succumbed to the virus.Similarly, the Supreme Court decided to step in after faulting the Centre's oxygen allocation methodology during the second surge of Covid, when each affected state has been demanding a higher allocation. The Centre asserted that a daily oxygen supply of 500-600 MT to Delhi would be enough to meet the demand from hospitals and cited the management of a similar Covid caseload by Mumbai on April 10 with an oxygen supply of around 280MT. But, the SC asserted that Delhi should get 700 MT of O2.The SC also thought it fit to permit the judiciary, through high courts, to manage the pan-India oxygen allocation. It gave a free hand to the HCs to determine the quantity of O2 required by the state and direct the Centre to provide the same. The case in point is the Karnataka HC order asking the Centre to supply 1200 MT of oxygen as against an allocation of 900MT.In contrast, the SC has not been able to manage a small issue of providing seamless video-conferencing facilities for the advocates to argue before benches even though more than a year has passed since the SC started conducting its judicial business through video-conference.The glitch-ridden system played so truantly that once Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul in a virtual hearing openly criticised the system and said if the Delhi HC could manage a better system why not the SC. But, the system remains unchanged. The advocates keep complaining about getting delinked abruptly. So much so that even the SC's E-Committee chairman Justice D Y Chandrachud got delinked once making an advocate to innocently comment - \"Justice Chandrachud has fallen off\". It created a mild panic but soon many realised that he had only \"fallen off\" the video link.",

According to NCPCR , in keeping with protocol, each caller is informed that adoption can be done only through a laid out legal procedure under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 and through the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA).They further share the legal procedure and information about how a call should be placed to Childline 1098 immediately for intervention, the role of police and also information on contacting the child welfare committee and CARA. NCPCR also plans to followup and track these cases through the call recordings in the coming days.In the backdrop of reports regarding children orphaned due to loss of parents to Covid-19 pandemic and posts circulating on social media, both the ministry of women and child development and NCPCR have written to states on measures related to rehabilitation of such children to ensure safety and prevent trafficking.

In an interview with AFP, Soumya Swaminathan warned that \u201cthe epidemiological features that we see in India today do indicate that it\u2019s an extremely rapidly spreading variant\u201d.Swaminathan, an Indian paediatrician and clinical scientist, said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 was clearly a contributing factor to the catastrophe unfolding in India. \u201cThere have been many accelerators that are fed into this,\u201d the 62-year-old said, stressing that \u201ca more rapidly spreading virus is one of them\u201d.The WHO recently listed B.1.617 as a \u201cvariant of interest\u201d. Several national health authorities, including in the US and Britain , have said they consider B.1.617 a variant of concern, and Swaminathan said she expected the WHO to soon follow suit. \u201cB.1.617 is likely to be a variant of concern because it has some mutations which increase transmission, and which also potentially could make (it) resistant to antibodies that are generated by vaccination or by natural infection,\u201d she said.But she insisted that the variant alone could not be blamed for the dramatic surge in cases and deaths seen in India, pointing to \u201chuge social mixing and large gatherings\u201d in recent months.",

So, for the well-being of our people and in the national interest, I urge you to consider the suggestions outlined in this letter,\u201d Kharge said.Among key suggestions, he said the government must use the Rs 35,000 crore allocated in the Union budget for free mass vaccination, adding that allowing private firms to set differential prices for vaccines would adversely impact Indians. \u201cI, therefore, urge you to not relinquish the state\u2019s moral duty in immunising citizens. This is completely doable because India has a history of successful, large-scale immunisation programmes,\u201d he added. Kharge reiterated Congress \u2019s demand to leverage compulsory licensing to increase vaccine production, besides waiver of GST on vaccines, PPE kits, ventilators and oxygen equipment.He said the government should expedite distribution of relief material from foreign countries.",

    "Text": "WASHINGTON: Less than a fortnight after President Joe Biden in his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged his country's steadfast support for the people of India, America has responded with an unprecedented financial assistance worth nearly USD half a billion.Biden spoke at length with Modi last month and conveyed solidarity with India in its fight against the viral disease. He assured the prime minister that the US and India will work closely together in the fight against Covid-19.\"Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,\" Biden had said in a tweet.Reflecting an overwhelming support for a \"natural ally\", the entire country not only the administration, but also the corporate sector which created a global task force, as well as Americans and Indian-Americans have opened their coffers for India.This half a billion dollars includes USD 100 million pledged by the Biden administration, USD 70 million by pharma major Pfizer and 450,000 Remdesivir doses, the governmental purchase price of each of which in the US is USD 390.Thousands of oxygen concentrators and plane loads of life saving drugs and health care equipment are flying off the United States for India almost every day.Several companies like Boeing and Mastercard have announced financial assistance worth USD 10 million each, Google has pledged USD 18 million, which the Global Task Force that comprises CEOs of top American companies have already pledged USD 30 million worth of life saving equipment.Describing it as a \u201cBerlin Life Moment\u201d, Mukesh Aghi of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), told PTI he expects the assistance to touch almost USD 1 billion by the end of the month. \u201cIt is emotional for the diaspora, almost everyone has someone who has been touched by Covid-19,\u201d he said.Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council (USIBC) said, \u201cThe outpouring of support from the United States over the past two weeks was a spontaneous mass mobilisation of support for the Indian people from across the America government, business community and diaspora community and the American people.\u201d\u201cIt is unprecedented, and it reflects both the deep bonds between our two countries and the gratitude that Americans feel for the role India played in supporting the United States when we were experiencing our Covid surge last year,\u201d she said.However, given the \u201cspeed and severity\u201d that have overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and local authorities, more assistance will be needed and for a sustained period of timescale of the pandemic, Biswal said.People of the country and the Diaspora too have come out in large numbers. Indian-American Vinod Khosla has committed USD 10 million, top corporate leader John T Chambers has promised USD 1 million.For the first time in its history, Sewa International has raised USD 15 million; American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) (USD 3.6 million), Indiaspora (USD 2.5) million and Jai Shetty has raised USD 4 million.\u201cThere has been overwhelming support and offers of assistance from the US Government, private sector, diaspora and the American public at large. In fact, in my interactions in recent days, the US interlocutors across the board ask me, \u2018tell us what more we can do for India'\u201d, India's ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI.\u201cThey recall with fondness the help India gave. These are reflective of strong partnership and close people to people ties between our both nations. We deeply appreciate these gestures. We will continue to engage with the US in our collective fight against the pandemic,\u201d he said.Among other major financial contributions announced include Procter and Gamble (USD 6.7 million); Merck (USD 5 million), Walmart (USD 2 million), Salesforce (USD 2.4 million), and Caterpillar (USD 3.4 million). Companies like Deloittee have announced to 12,000 oxygen concentrators to India.While Microsoft is partnering with the US government in providing aid and oxygen, FedEx and UPS have taken up the mantle of taking care of the transportation of life saving health care equipment like oxygen cylinders, ventilators and oxygen concentrators to India.On Sunday, Indian-Americans from Tamil Nadu including eminent philanthropist M R Rangaswami, held a \u201cHelp Tamil Nadu Breathe\u201d to raise USD 1.5 million in few hours.\u201cThis is an incredible outpouring of generosity, which people have come to expect from America. When the world has a crisis, beyond politics, beyond dispute America steps up,\u201d Rangaswami said.\u201cIt is comforting to see US cargo jets with much needed medical supplies landing at the Delhi airport regularly,\u201d said Karun Rishi, president of the USA-India Chambers of Commerce.Noting that the stakes are very high for the entire world, he said India's success or failure to come out of this once in a century crisis will have a direct impact throughout the world.Echoing Biswal, Rishi said that more needs to be done.\u201cThe scale of assistance to India needs to increase and speeded up. To make some reasonable impact to tide over this crisis, India may need between USD 25-USD 50 billion in assistance in the form of vaccines, technology transfer, increasing vaccines and therapeutics manufacturing capacity, medical equipment and public health measures,\u201d he said.",

Chandrasekhar Rao has sanctioned appointment of about 50,000 MBBS degree holders for COVID duties on ad hoc basis to bring down pressure on health staff in the midst of a raging second wave of the pandemic.\n\nDoctors with MBBS degree, nurses, lab technicians, pharmacists and other para medical staff must be appointed immediately for two to three months, he told an official meeting that was held to review the pandemic situation on Sunday.\n\nA release said Mr. Rao ordered respectable pay to all those who are to be appointed as they would be rendering valuable service to the State. They should be given weightage during appointment in regular government jobs in future.\n\nThose interested in joining the service could apply online by logging in to \u2018https://odls.telangana.gov.in/medical recruitment/Home.aspx\u2019.\n\nMr. Rao also urged qualified nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians and para medics to come forth to render service.\n\nThe release added that Mr. Rao decided to start super specialty hospitals in Warangal and Adilabad immediately, and appoint medical and health staff there.\n\nA 250-bed super speciality hospital of MGM Hospital at Warangal could start from the nearby Kakatiya Medical College campus and another such hospital of similar bed strength could commence at RIMS, Adilabad, immediately.\n\n\u2018Release funds\u2019\n\nHe instructed Principal Secretary of Finance, K. Ramakrishna Rao, to immediately release \u20b936 crore for the facility in Warangal and \u20b920 crore for the one in Adilabad. He asked officials to take steps to appoint 363 staff at the hospital in Warangal and another 366 personnel in Adilabad.\n\nImmediate action should be initiated for the recruitment of those 729 staff.\n\nDuring the review, Mr. Rao enquired about the availability of oxygen, beds, Remdesivir injections and other facilities at hospitals. He was told by officials that there was no shortage of oxygen supply. There were 7,393 beds available in government hospitals, along with another 2,470 beds fitted with oxygen lines and 600 beds with ventilators.\n\nMr. Rao spoke to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to brief him about the steps taken by the State government to contain COVID-19. He suggested that the rapid spreaders of virus should be identified and administered vaccine first. He wanted guidelines to be relaxed to include in a special category for vaccination cab drivers, auto drivers, bus conductors, cooking gas cylinder suppliers and workers who have to cover many places throughout the day for their daily work. The Union Minister promised to discuss the suggestion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",

However, when contacted, the agency, Crystal Infosystems and Services, which is contracted by the BBMP to provide personnel, refused to comment on the issue.\n\nAyesha, one of the staffers in the South Zone war room, said while they had been assured of getting their jobs back, there was no clarity on where they would be posted. \u201cPreferably, we want to be posted back to the South Zone war room, as that is where we were unfairly targeted for no fault of ours and removed from work,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Surya and three BJP MLAs had stormed the war room last week and live-streamed an \u201cexpose\u201d of an alleged bed-blocking scam. Mr. Surya read out the names of 16 Muslim youths and questioned their role in the scam.

In a way, we were asked to prove ourselves innocent,\u201d said one of the 17 personnel who had been targeted.",

    "Text": "Health status of staff and family members being monitored through WhatsApp groups\n\nIn an attempt to prevent the police personnel who are coming in close contact with the public from contracting coronavirus infection, the Prakasam Police have launched several measures including a dedicated WhatsApp group to monitor the health status of the department staff and their family members.\n\nA sizeable number of the police personnel are contracting the infection in the line of duty disease including enforcing the curfew in force to check the spread of the virus. Prakasam SP Siddharth Kaushal said elaborate guidelines for police stations, staff and their family members had been issued. Among the preventive measures is \u2018Police Family Self Health Groups\u2019 (PFSHGs) with the concept of \u2018all for one, all for all\u2019.\n\nAs part of the initiative, WhatsApp groups have been created with the personnel and family members through which their health status is being monitored by roping in medical officers and promoting COVID-safe behaviour.\n\nRandom call\n\n\u201cThe COVID Family Welfare Desk randomly calls 50 personnel daily and monitor their health status. The latest updates related to the infection and various posts relating to information, education, communication activities are being shared among the WhatsApp group members,\u201d said Mr. Kaushal.\n\nApart from dos and don\u2019ts, videos, infographics, vaccination sites, COVID designated hospitals and details of available hospital beds are also being shared. The group members are being sensitised on healthy diet, nutritional supplements, life saving drugs and etc. The success stories are also being shared among the SHFG members to help them cope with the pandemic crisis.\n\nCOVID-safe behaviour\n\nThe SP also call the personnel and speak to their family members. Playing the role of level-1 mentor, the SP underscored the need for following the \u2018Dasha Sutras\u2019 and 'Pancha Sutras', a series of guidelines pertaining to COVID-safe behaviour that need to be followed by the personnel at their both at work and home.\n\nMore than 150 family members of police personnel have been infected by the virus and nine of them are in a critical condition, sources said.\n\nDaily status report\n\nTaking a cue from the SP, 16 level-1 mentors including Additional SPs interact with the police personnel and their family members within 66 police station limits across the district. Fourteen Deputy SPs have been appointed as nodal officers to monitor the health status of 3,600 police personnel in the district on a daily basis and prepare daily status report.\n\nDuring his whirlwind visit of the busy junctions in Ongole on Sunday, Mr. Kaushal said the curfew was yielding a good result in the form of reduced number of new infections.",

    "Text": "Volunteers have stepped up to help patients, kin\n\nOn Thursday, Pritam Singh helped cremate a 24-year-old man. But that wasn\u2019t his worst experience over the past year. He remembers having to carry the body of a man past his young son, saying they were just taking him into a hospital emergency. \u201cThe family had told us not to reveal that his father had died,\u201d he says.\n\nMr. Singh and his team of seven, has, over the past year, supported free of cost, about 400 families struggling to perform the last rites of kin who have died of COVID-19. \u201cUsually, when we go to a house, there are only two or three people. At the most, neighbours will come out of their homes when we are putting the body into the ambulance, but otherwise, there is no one to help,\u201d says the 48-year-old, who heads United Sikhs. The lack of support from those they thought they could lean on and the breakdown in government machinery is what both angers and grieves people, he says.\n\nMr. Singh and his team have helped with Hindu and Sikh cremations and Muslim and Christian burials, but feel bad that they have to turn down many people simply because they have neither the volunteers nor the vehicles. Last year, the daily calls were four or five; this year, it is 18-20.\n\nFor a group of men who work at their businesses or in IT, their ages ranging from 20s-40s, dealing with death every day has not been easy. \u201cHum roz rote hain (we cry every day),\u201d Mr. Singh says.\n\nIn Gurugram, Honey Tandon, who started Helping Hands to provide meals, says people are donating in kind \u2014 flour, pulses and fruit.\n\nEven as Mr Singh starts his day at 6:30 a.m. in West Delhi\u2019s Tilak Nagar, in Gurugram dietician Honey Tandon packs breakfast for a few guards and people who live outside her condo gates. She quickly gives her father and son the same food and rushes out.\n\nMs. Tandon began Helping Hands free of cost for those in her building who got COVID and a few workers who had planned to go back their villages. \u201cSoon people in other parts of Gurgaon started asking for home cooked meals, so I began charging \u20b9100 per meal, from those who can afford it,\u201d she says. For those who can\u2019t, it\u2019s free.\n\nIn the three weeks that Helping Hands has been operational, it has provided about 30 meals each for lunch and dinner, with fewer for breakfast. People have started reaching out with donations in kind \u2013 flour, pulses and fruit.\n\n\u201cMy husband buys the groceries, and my father begins cutting the vegetables in the morning,\u201d Ms Tandon says, adding that she spends a lot of time in the kitchen. She confesses she hasn\u2019t really cooked on a regular basis till the recent crisis. \u201cMy husband joked that people wouldn\u2019t be able to eat the rotis, but they\u2019re getting better,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\nThe Tandon couple deliver every meal in their car or on an electric scooter that EVeez has lent them. Now Ms. Tandon has started a fund raiser so she can feed more people.\n\nWhile she has been able to sustain the service for some time, a number of people like Ruby, 23, find it difficult. Now posted as a vaccine volunteer with the Civil Defence in the Maulana Azad Medical College centre, Ms. Ruby\u2019s reasons for offering her services are a mix of being pragmatic and wanting to help. She is honest: \u201cI love to wear the uniform,\u201d she says.\n\nShe lost her job as a receptionist, and a friend suggested she join the Civil Defence. In the central district, she is one of 5,922 volunteers. She gets a daily allowance of \u20b9763, and has a 9 to 5 shift, but says as a first responder in various crisis situations, a lot of the work is \u201cnishkam seva\u201d (service without the expectation of receiving anything in return).\n\n\u201cI will continue to do this if I can, if my family is ok with it,\u201d she says, understanding that she also needs to contribute to her family of mother, three sisters and two brothers.\n\nDoctor on call\n\nServing Delhi from fae away Durg, in Chhattisgarh is Dr. Tapesh Nagaria, who works with the Human Solidarity Foundation helpline (9971736222). Having taken a gap year to study for his post graduate entrance exams, he thought it a good opportunity to both help people and gain some experience. \u201cI was really nervous, because medical school doesn\u2019t prepare you for the real world,\u201d he says.\n\nThe real world here was a host of different things \u2014 of a new disease that doctors themselves were grappling with, of the fact that even when he knew the patient needed to be in a hospital there were none to be had, and of people sharing medication lists with each other and self-medicating.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do when a drug is not available? Or when an HRCT is needed but I will be putting another life in danger because the patient will not go alone to a hospital? Or when I need to prescribe blood thinners, but these are ideally given only when a doctor can monitor the patient?\u201d He prefers to err on the side of least medication, and also makes sure his prescription is watermarked with the name of the patient, so it can\u2019t be forwarded. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very steep learning curve.\u201d\n\nAbout 70% of callers to the network of about 30 doctors are from Delhi, though the helpline is open to people across India, free of cost.\n\nYouth brigade\n\nThe phone is everyone\u2019s lifeline, even as lockdowns put a pause on movement. An NGO, Caregiver Saathi, is using phones to verify information related to COVID-19, so caregivers have lists of ambulances, blood banks, and other resources that work. They put out a call for volunteers and 44 children \u2014 all under 18 \u2014 registered. Many had had their own experiences with COVID and wanted to help.\n\nIn Bengaluru, Nimisha Maria Nishant, 15, who heads the teams for Haryana, says the first time someone died and she couldn\u2019t source information in time, she broke down. \u201cIt was emotionally exhausting, but my team mates helped me.\u201d\n\nFellow volunteer, Gurgaon-based Mahira Vohra, 16, says, \u201cWhen leadership fails to provide us with even basic healthcare, it\u2019s upto us to make the community better; to step up and do something.\u201d",

Media reports that sanction was for being MLA is incorrect,\u201d Mr. Dhankhar said in a tweet, sharing a detailed press statement issued by the Raj Bhavan.\n\nThe matter pertains to the Narada sting videos which is being probed by the CBI. The tapes had come to the fore in 2016 where several Ministers and leaders of the Trinamool Congress were purportedly seen accepting cash on camera. The Governor said the sanction was because they were Ministers and were appointed by the Governor.\n\nTrinamool Congress leader Sukhendu Sekhar Roy differed saying they were MLAs, the sanction should have come from the Speaker.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the sanction to a Central investigation agency should come from the Speaker as the leaders were MLAs. However, this is a matter of law and the Courts can deal with it,\u201d the party spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP told The Hindu.\n\nMr. Roy, however, questioned the timing of the tweet by the Governor and said it comes to the public domain just a day before the Ministers of the TMC government are likely to be sworn in. \u201cWe have put it on record in a letter to the President that the conduct of the Governor is partisan and is to further the interests of the BJP. We stick to our stand,\u201d he said.\n\nThe press statement by the Raj Bhavan pointed out that the \u201csanction came to be accorded by the Hon\u2019ble Governor after CBI had made request and made available entire documentation relevant to the case to the Hon\u2019ble Governor and he invoked his powers under Articles 163 and 164 of the Constitution to accord such sanction\u201d.\n\nFour of those mentioned in the communication are key TMC leaders and were elected to the Assembly. Mr. Chatterjee has since defected to the BJP. Several prominent leaders of the TMC were seen in the purported Narada tapes including Suvendu Adhikari who is now a key BJP leader.",

Suddenly, one night, her saturation levels fell below 90 and I used a Nebuliser to bring back the saturation level to normal,\u201d he recalled.\n\nWith little improvement, Ms. Swaroopa was rushed to a corporate hospital in Secunderabad where an HRTCT Scan revealed severe lung infection. \u201cOn doctor\u2019s advice, we admitted her in the hospital. On the third day, her condition worsened with a sharp decline in her saturation levels. Her BP and sugar levels fell alarmingly, prompting the doctors to wheel her into the COVID-19 ICU to revive her,\u201d Mr. Rohith said.\n\nMore trouble was in store for the son, who himself had mild COVID-19. Doctors asked to arrange for a plasma donor. \u201cFinding a plasma donor for my mother\u2019s blood group \u2014 Bombay Blood Group \u2014 a rare phenotype blood group found in four per million of the world population was a Herculean Task. After two days of search, we gave up the efforts ,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Ms. Swaroopa\u2019s condition becoming a cause of concern, she was put on a ventilator. \u201cMy heartbeat slipped for a second when the doctors told us to be prepared for any eventuality as her condition was critical,\u201d said Mr. Rohith. \u201cI used to hang around in the hospital praying for my mother\u2019s miraculous recovery. My sister Rachel Pranitha Wood, who works for a global pharma company in Ohio, U.S. rushed back to Hyderabad on hearing her mom\u2019s worsening health condition,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nFor almost a month the brother-sister duo took turns to take care of their mother. \u201cOn February 9, my mother was discharged from the hospital after spending one month in hospital with 15 days alone in ICU. Today is May 9 and almost three months after the discharge, she is still struggling to be normal. The family ran a bill of \u20b922.5 lakh for the treatment,\u201d Ms. Rachel told The Hindu.\n\nMs. Swaroopa, post-COVID-19 recovery, needs help from an attendant to do her day-to-day work. \u201cWhile I was in the hospital, I did not realise the gravity of the situation. But once I started recovering I became emotional and used to cry. My only prayer to God was to take care of my children in my absence. A lesson that I learned is never to neglect any ailment. Early diagnosis and proper healthcare with strong willpower will ensure you can come out unscathed with the near encounter with death,\u201d Ms. Swaroopa told The Hindu on Sunday.\n\nShe credits the doctors of the corporate hospital, who worked overtime to see she overcame the health challenges. In particular, she says she is indebted to MS. D. Divya, IAS, Commissioner, Women Development and Child Welfare department, who was in constant touch with hospital authorities monitoring her condition.",

    "Text": "Gender- and age group-wise case distribution remains same\n\nThough Tamil Nadu is yet to see the peak of the second wave of COVID-19, a comparison of the cases and deaths reported so far with those in the first wave shows noticeable changes in the age and gender distribution of deaths. The proportion of women and people of younger age among the deceased have increased in the second wave.\n\nHowever, the comparison shows no significant differences in the age and gender distribution of cases. (Please read the note in the infographic for the number of deaths and cases taken for analysis.)\n\nWhile women accounted for 27% of all the deaths in the first wave, they have accounted for nearly 33.5% of all the deaths thus far in the second wave. But the gender distribution of cases remains the same, with women accounting for 40% and men 60%. Similarly, while those aged 21-60 accounted for 38.7% of the deaths in the first wave, they have accounted for 43.6% in the second wave. In comparison, the percentage of those aged 60 and above among the deceased has declined from 61% in the first wave to 56.3% in the second wave. However, there has been no shift in the reported cases. In fact, the percentage of the elderly among the cases has increased from 13.1% in the first wave to 14.4% in the second wave.\n\nThe number of deaths reported daily during the second wave has been on a steep increase, with more than 1,200 deaths occurring in the past one week alone. In comparison, during the 12-week period from July to September, there were a total of nearly 7,900 deaths. However, the case fatality rate appears lower, at least for now, than in the first wave. While the case fatality rate was around 1.62% at the peak of the first wave from July to September, it is around 1.03% as of now. While the decline in the case fatality rate is seen among all age groups and gender, it is more pronounced among the elderly. They, however, remain the most vulnerable with a case fatality rate of 3.91%, compared with the the overall rate of 1.03%.\n\nV. Ramasubramanian, senior consultant, infectious diseases, Apollo Hospitals, pointed to the stark difference in the restrictions during the first wave and since this year. \u201cPeople are not staying indoors, and therefore there is more exposure for people of all age groups, including children, leading to more infections,\u201d he said. Asked why more people of younger age were among the deceased, he said a possible factor was the delay in getting medical attention, with the perception that the disease would not affect them severely. However, he said, this required further study. K. Kolandaisamy, former Director of Public Health, Tamil Nadu, said a clearer picture would emerge only after the second wave played out fully. \u201cA higher volume of cases will mean that more from the younger age group with detected and undetected vulnerabilities or co-morbidities will be among the infected, and they will account for more fatalities,\u201d he said.\n\nPrithvi Mohandas, managing doctor, MIOT International Hospital, recently co-authored a paper published in Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health on the hospital\u2019s experience in treating COVID-19 patients in the first wave. He said the relaxed curbs and disregard for precautions led to more exposure for all age groups. Many of the relatively younger age, who require hospitalisation, resorted to home care and went to hospitals only when the illness became severe. \u201cIf you have pneumonia on CT, coupled with raised disease activity in the blood tests, do not sit at home measuring your oxygen level,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said an encouraging thing was that the hospital had not seen any case of COVID-19 pneumonia among those vaccinated.",

Uttar Pradesh (\u20b91,441.6 crore), Maharashtra (\u20b9861.4 crore) and Bihar (\u20b9741.8 crore) secured the lion\u2019s share of the release while the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh got \u20b9387.8 crore.\n\nThe grant is meant for utilisation by all three tiers of the panchayat raj institutions at village, mandal and district levels in the State. The grant, released on the recommendation of the Panchayat Raj Ministry, constituted the first instalment of the united grants for the current financial year.\n\nThough the 1st instalment of the untied grants was supposed to be released next month, according to the 15th Finance Commission recommendations, the grant had been released in advance of the normal schedule in view of the ongoing pandemic situation. The release of the grant would augment resources of the panchayats in fighting the contagion.\n\nThe Ministry said it had also relaxed certain conditions in the release of the grant amount keeping in view the prevailing situation. These conditions included online availability of the accounts of a certain percentage of rural local bodies in public domain. Taking into consideration the prevailing circumstances, the condition had been waived for the release of the first instalment of untied grants.",

A CT scan revealed lung damage. A couple of days later when the second scan revealed severe damage he was shifted to a private hospital in Nungambakkam.\n\nMr. Nagarajan said he has been mildly hypertensive and on pills to control BP for over a decade. Within four days over 75% of his lung was damaged as the infection spread. He needed oxygen support and soon he became unconscious. He was put on ventilator and transferred to the intensive care unit.\n\nAs his condition deteriorated his family was told to be prepared for any eventuality. \u201cThe most critical day was November 30. The doctors told us to inform the family. His brothers and sisters were informed,\u201d his wife Latha said.\n\nMeanwhile the doctors had administered five injections of Remdesivir, Mr. Nagarajan learned later.\n\nHe had been in hospital for over a month.

When he recovered consciousness he was put on physiotherapy.\n\n\u201cHe had to undergo physiotherapy twice a day. He had to walk along with the oxygen cylinder tank. Doctors said he was physically weak. They said he would be discharged only if he can start breathing on his own,\u201d Ms. Latha recalled.\n\nOn January 4, 58 days after he had been hospitalised, Mr. Nagarajan was discharged. He was advised rest at home to recuperate. Around 45 days ago he returned to work.\n\n\u201cI was optimistic and always felt he would come back.

The trio has since been occasionally raiding the crops in the plain areas of Nagari, Puttur, Narayanavanam and Karveti Nagaram mandals and has taken shelter behind hillocks and sparse jungles.\n\nAt present, one of the three elephants has got separated from the group, and is currently on the prowl at Kailasanatha Kona tourist spot at the foot of Nagari hills.

Any overzealous, though well-meaning, judicial intervention may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences... in absence of any expert advice or administrative experience, leaving doctors, scientists, experts and executive very little room to find innovative solutions on the go,\" the centre said.\n\n\"Pricing of vaccines is not only reasonable but uniform across the country (after) government persuasion with two vaccine companies,\" the centre added, noting that several states had announced plans to vaccinate the 18-45 age group for free.\n\nThe Supreme Court last week directed the centre to reconsider prices - \"to ensure it withstands scrutiny of Articles 14 (equality before law) and Article 21 (protection of life and personal liberty)\".\n\nThat was after manufacturers Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech announced vastly different prices for the centre, states and private hospitals.\n\nWhile the centre continues to spend only Rs 150 per dose for either Serum Institute's Covishield or Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, states must pay Rs 400 per dose for Covaxin and private hospitals Rs 1,200. Covishield costs Rs 300 per dose for states and Rs 600 for private hospitals.\n\nShortage of vaccine doses has forced vaccination centres in several states to shut down (File)\n\nPrices for states and private hospitals were originally higher and were reduced only after outrage.\n\nThe vast difference in prices also triggered a political storm, with the Congress accusing the centre of \"vaccine profiteering\" and sarcastically reminding it of the \"one nation, one price\" war cry.\n\nThe centre pointed out it would get 50 per cent of vaccine supply and that this would be supplied to states for free. However, it made no comment on the higher prices of the remaining 50 per cent.\n\nLast week the Supreme Court said compelling states to negotiate with manufacturers, on grounds of promoting competition and making it attractive for new manufacturers, would adversely affect those in the 18-44 age group, whose vaccination has only just begun.\n\nIndia began vaccination in January and has administered over 17 crore doses so far but the pace has been questioned, with states running out of stock and shutting down centres.\n\nSeveral, including national capital Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan, deferred the start of the third phase over a lack of doses.\n\nSo far two vaccine options are available, with a third - Russia's Sputnik V - having been cleared for emergency use and expected to be rolled out soon. In its affidavit the centre also said it is in consultation with manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to bring in their products.\n\nThe vaccination policy has been criticised by international medical journal The Lancet, which called it \"botched\" and said the government had vaccinated less than two per cent of the population so far.\n\nThe Supreme Court is hearing issues surrounding vaccination and the availability of medical resources - hospital beds and oxygen - as the country battles a huge wave of daily Covid cases.",

    "Text": "People sit outside Pune railway station during lockdown restrictions imposed by the state government.\n\nAfter dipping into his savings to weather India's snap pandemic lockdown last March, Manoj Kumar was just getting his head above water again earning 600 rupees ($8) a day as a construction worker in the tourist hotspot of Goa.\n\nHe'd squirreled away enough for a trip last month to his native village in Bihar some 1,490 miles away for a wedding. He's still there, stuck in one of the nation's least developed states, as a fierce second Covid-19 wave triggers the world's worst health crisis and prevents his return. On a lucky day, he'll land some odd jobs that fetch him as much as 300 rupees. But there aren't too many of those chores left. So he's taking loans to feed and clothe his wife and three kids.\n\n\"It is all in God's hands now,\" said Kumar, who's told his wife to curtail spending on items such as lentils, cooking oil and clothes. \"I don't know when I will return. My family is worried and doesn't want me to go back as the cases are also rising in Goa.\"\n\nKumar, 40, is one of the millions of migrant workers who form part of India's vast unreported informal sector, which accounts for half of its $2.9 trillion, domestic demand-driven economy. A protracted Covid wave is shrinking incomes and wiping out savings of people like Kumar, posing the risk of a double whammy for Asia's third-largest economy that's still struggling to recover from last year's pandemic-induced recession.\n\nThe government estimates India's gross domestic product shrank 8% in the year ended March, its biggest contraction since 1952. Many economists are cutting their forecasts for the current fiscal year as rising unemployment and dwindling savings dim the chances of a double-digit growth. Shaun Roache, chief economist for Asia Pacific at S&P Global Ratings, slashed his prediction to 9.8% from 11% earlier. Fitch Solutions sees the economy expanding by 9.5%, a projection that's below the Bloomberg consensus of around 11%.\n\n\"A drawn-out Covid-19 outbreak will impede India's economic recovery,\" Singapore-based Roache said. \"The country already faces a permanent loss of output versus its pre-pandemic path, suggesting a long-term production deficit equivalent to about 10% of GDP.\"\n\nWith the latest surge caused by a new coronavirus strain, total infections in India have risen to 21.89 million, a third of which were added just in the past three weeks alone. Daily death count hit a record at 4,187 on Saturday. Experts have warned the crisis has the potential to worsen in the coming weeks, with one model predicting as many as 1,018,879 deaths by the end of July, quadrupling from the current official count of 238,270.\n\nHarsh and Sudden\n\nAs new travel restrictions are put in place in some of the nation's biggest economic centers to contain the outbreak, India's poor are likely to bear the brunt again, just as they did in 2020. They have yet to recover from the lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in late March last year. The harsh and sudden measure sparked an exodus of migrant workers from cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi, as they trekked hundreds of miles to reach home.\n\nPeople like Kumar typically work without contracts and often for a pittance. The so-called informal economy in India employs approximately 411 million workers, according to calculations by Jeemol Unni, a professor of economics at Ahmedabad University, who relied on surveys by the government's National Statistical Office to arrive at the number. While the low-paying farm sector employs the bulk of them, construction comes second with about 56 million.\n\nUnprotected by unions and politicians, these laborers often miss out on handouts from governments. After meeting daily expenses, they are left with little to pay for health care and medicines -- a risky situation especially when a pathogen is taking lives and sending thousands to intensive care at overcrowded hospitals running short of beds.\n\nDip in Savings\n\nEconomists warn depleting household savings and falling incomes will have an impact on domestic consumption, which accounts for almost 60% of GDP. A study by Nikhil Gupta, an economist at Mumbai-based brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd., found that India's household savings dropped to 22.1% of GDP in the quarter through December, from 28.1% in the three months ended June last year. Full-year numbers show India's savings growth lagged behind the likes of the U.S., the U.K. and Japan, he said.\n\n\"A slower rise in household savings, coupled with similar or slower decline in consumption, confirms weak income growth in India,\" Gupta said. \"If so, the contribution of pent-up demand in growth recovery would also be limited in India compared with other nations.\"\n\nData showed April jobless rate increased to nearly 8% from 6.5% in March, with more than seven million exiting the workforce last month, according to data from Center for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt., a private research firm.\n\nAs a result of all the turmoil that started last year, income inequality is deepening in India. A study by Pew Research Center has shown an estimated 75 million people slipped into poverty since the pandemic began. The second wave is set to crush some more. For the study, Pew considered daily incomes of 150 rupees or less as poor, 151 to 750 rupees as low income and 3,750 rupees and above as high income.\n\nA study by the Azim Premji University in Bangalore showed even more alarming numbers. About 230 million individuals slid below the national daily minimum wage threshold of 375 rupees during the pandemic, it said.\n\nThough India could still emerge as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, it will also be one of the most unequal countries, Oxfam, a non-profit organization said.\n\nStephen Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone Group Inc., said in an interview last month that he's \"confident\" of the long-term prospects of India. The private-equity firm, which has plowed billions of dollars into the country and owns many of the nation's big office towers, said it would be accelerating its activities in the country. \"We will be investing more in the next 10 years than we have invested in the previous period,\" he said.\n\nDuvvuri Subbarao, a former governor of India's central bank, said the strife faced by the informal-economy workers could hurt India's long-term growth prospects. \"Inequalities have intensified because the formal sector has nearly normalized while the informal sector remains distressed,\" he said.\n\nSlower growth would be bad news for workers like A.K. Singh, who was a cook for a monthly salary of about 20,000 rupees in a restaurant in Mumbai. He fled recently to his home town of Gorakhpur in northern India to start a tire business, for which he's waiting for a loan.\n\n\"I used some of my savings and money I received from my last salary,\" he said. \"But there's a lockdown here too for the past week. My shop was hardly open for two days during the week. What will we earn out of that?",

    "Text": "The Governor has said he has the authority to sanction prosecution of the four leaders. (FILE)\n\nWest Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar - known for his frequent collision with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee - has given his nod to the CBI to prosecute four erstwhile ministers of her government in the Narada tapes scandal.\n\nTwo of the former ministers, now facing CBI prosecution, were sworn in on Monday by the Governor himself. Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim were named in a list of 43 ministers released on Sunday.\n\nThe sanction and its timing is raising eyebrows, coming as it does just after Mamata Banerjee's resounding victory in the assembly elections that had turned into a direct fight between her and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and also because Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla is yet to sanction the prosecution of Suvendu Adhikari, a former Trinamool Congress minister who is now a BJP MLA from Nandigram.\n\nMr Adhikari was a Trinamool MP in Lok Sabha at the time of the commission of the crime. He beat Mamata Banerjee at Nandigram by less than 2,000 votes.\n\nIn 2014, a journalist from Delhi came to Kolkata, posed as a businessman planning to invest in Bengal, gave wads of cash to seven Trinamool MPs, four ministers, one MLA and a police officer as bribe and taped the entire operation. The tapes were released just before the 2016 assembly elections in the state.\n\nThe two other former ministers whom the Governor has now cleared for prosecution are Madan Mitra, a Trinamool MLA not named minister in the new government, and Sovan Chatterjee who left Trinamool in August 2019, joined the BJP but quit in March. He did not contest the just-concluded polls.\n\n\"Governor accorded sanction for prosecution... being the appointing authority of ministers @MamataOfficial under article 164 and thus competent authority,\" the Governor tweeted on Sunday evening.\n\nGovernor accorded sanction for prosecution of Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra & Sovan Chatterjee being appointing authority of Ministers \u2066@MamataOfficial\u2069 under Article 164 & thus competent authority\n\n\n\nMedia reports that sanction was for being MLA is incorrect. pic.twitter.com/vqEg7Cv6OW \u2014 Governor West Bengal Jagdeep Dhankhar (@jdhankhar1) May 9, 2021\n\nHe was responding, a press release by Raj Bhavan said, to some media reports that he had given his sanction for prosecution because all four where members of the legislative assembly at the time of commission of crime.\n\nJust as the Speaker of Lok Sabha has to sanction prosecution of any MP, the Speaker of the state assembly should sanction prosecution of MLAs. But in the Narada scam, the CBI did not ask the Bengal assembly Speaker for sanction but approached the Governor instead.\n\nThe Governor has said he has the authority to sanction prosecution not because the four leaders named were MLAs but because they were ministers sworn in by him in 2011.\n\nOf the seven Trinamool MPs named in the Narada case, six were from Lok Sabha and Mukul Roy from Rajya Sabha. Mukul Roy is now with BJP and just elected MLA. There has been no action against him. In the sting tapes, he was not actually seen taking cash.\n\nOf six Lok Sabha MPs, Sultan Ahmed has died. The CBI has sought to prosecute Suvendu Adhikari, Sougata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Prasun Banerjee and Aparupa Poddar. The Lok Sabha Speaker has not granted sanction.\n\nThe four former ministers taped taking bribes were Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim, Sovan Chatterjee and Madan Mitra.\n\nThe MLA involved was Iqbal Ahmed. The police officer was SMH Mirza.",

His complaints come barely a fortnight after the Chief Minister denied any scarcity of oxygen in the state's hospitals and promised strong action, including seizure of property, against people \"spreading rumours\".\n\nThere is a scarcity of oxygen in Bareilly, which he represents in parliament, Mr Gangwar said. Ventilators and other medical equipment are being sold in the black market. People in the Health department do not pick up phones, creating difficulty for Covid patients, he added.\n\nThe Union minister also sought that oxygen plants be installed in the hospitals of Bareilly and the process of referring Covid patients to hospital be simplified.\n\nAsked about the letter, Mr Gangwar told reporters that the complaints and suggestions had come from the people, and he had only passed it on to the Chief Minister.\n\n\"I think the points they raised were valid and these can be investigated and decided on,\" he said. \"I think oxygen is just a temporary problem. It will get solved. But there should be no black marketing,\" he added.\n\nYogi Adityanath had recently asserted that there was no shortage of oxygen in any Covid hospital of the state, private or government. \"Every infected patient does not need oxygen,\" he had told reporters late last month, seeking cooperation to spread awareness about this.\n\nAt the time, he also asked officials to take action under the National Security Act and seize the properties of people who spread \"rumours\" and \"propaganda\".\n\nHe, however, admitted that black marketing and hoarding were problems, \"which will be tackled with a heavy hand\".\n\nCongress's Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had called him out over his remarks.\n\n\"Mr. Chief Minister, there is an oxygen emergency in the entire state,\" she had tweeted. \"If you want to file a case against me, seize my property, do so. But for God's sake recognise the seriousness of the situation and get down to saving people's lives immediately,\" her tweet in Hindi read.\n\nOver the last 24 hours, 736 new Covid cases have been logged in Bareilly, the number of active cases is 6,387.\n\nSave A Life.

    "Text": "Anurag Thakur informed 1.5 lakh doses of vaccine Sputnik V have already reached (FILE)\n\nAfter Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi offering suggestions to tackle COVID-19, Union Minister of State (MoS) for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur on Sunday gave point wise responses elaborating measures taken by the Centre and rectifying some of the \"misconceptions\" in the letter.\n\nMr Thakur posted Kharge's letter to PM Modi on his Twitter handle and said on government supplies, GST is also paid by the government. \"From GST collected on the vaccine, half is earned by the Centre and another half by the States. 41 per cent of Centre's collections also get devolved to the States. States end up receiving almost 70 per cent of the total revenue collected from vaccines,\" he explained.\n\n\"A nominal 5 per cent GST is in the interest of the domestic manufacturer of vaccine and in the interest of citizens. If full exemption from GST is given, vaccine manufacturers would not be able to offset their input taxes and would pass them on to the end consumer/citizen by increasing the price. A 5 per cent GST rate ensures that the manufacturer is able to utilise Input Tax Credit (ITC) and in case of overflow of ITC, claim a refund. Exemption to the vaccine from GST would be counterproductive without benefiting the consumer,\" the MoS said.\n\nCalling India's COVID-19 vaccination drive 'world's fastest and largest', he said 15 crore people have been vaccinated in 103 days. While 17.56 crore vaccine doses were provided to States/UTs free of cost, 72 lakh doses were still available with States/UTs to be administered. \"More than 46 lakh doses in addition will be received by States/UTs in the next 3 days. COVID vaccines are being provided free of cost by the Government of India to those who are 45 years of age and above and to all frontline workers,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe informed that 1.5 lakh doses of COVID vaccine Sputnik V have already reached India and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has also tied up with local Indian companies for bulk production.\n\n1.5 Lk doses of Sputnik V have already reached India and RDIF has also tied up with local Indian companies for bulk production. \u2014 Anurag Thakur (@ianuragthakur) May 9, 2021\n\nSpeaking about Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), he said: \"Not only did NDA Government double the allocation during the COVID period last year from Rs 61,500 crore to a historic high of over Rs 1 lakh crore, but also increased the wages to Rs 202 thereby ensuring 300 crore person days of work in total. And it is demand driven.\"\n\nIn order to augment availability of these items, he said that the government also provided full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess to their commercial imports.\"GST rates varying 5 per cent (on vaccines), 12 per cent (COVID drugs, oxygen concentrators) is applicable to domestic supplies and commercial import of items.\n\n\"Assistance to States/UTs 6,608 Oxy Concentrators, 3,856 Oxy Cylinders, 1500 PSA plants being set up across country via PMCARES and PSUs 4,330 ventilators/ Bi PAP/ C PAP, Over 3 lakh Remdesivir vials delivered/dispatched, 400 ex-AMC/SSC medics, released between 2017-2021 expected to be recruited.\n\nMr Kharge on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Modi and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and suggested convening an all-party meeting and virtual meetings of Parliament Standing Committees to discuss the COVID-19 situation in the country.\n\n\"Use Rs 35,000 crore allocated in the Union Budget to ensure free vaccine for all. Leverage compulsory licensing to increase production of vaccines,\" reads Kharge's letter.\n\nHe further suggested to expand the scope of MNREGA to 200 days.\n\nWith 4,03,738 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, India continued to report more than four lakh daily coronavirus infections for the fourth day on the trot.\n\nWith this, the cumulative national tally of the infection went up to 2,22,96,414, the union health ministry said on Sunday morning.\n\nSave A Life.

    "Text": "India has recorded over 2.66 crore Covid cases since the pandemic broke.\n\nAnger over the scale of devastation in the fierce second wave of Covid and its impact on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has caused deep disquiet in the ranks of the ruling BJP and its ideological mentor Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), sources say. In seven years of PM Modi in power, public perception and election results have never spooked the powerful \"Sangh Parivar\" this much.\n\nSources say the BJP and RSS are concerned with the perception that the government dropped the ball on Covid, given that almost everyone in the ruling party's core support base is affected by the deadly pandemic. The middle class are the worst-hit -- and now the virus is spreading to the villages, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\n\n\"If you lose someone, the grief and anger remains for a long period and it can be expressed in any form,\" a leader told NDTV, implying that there is a big worry in the ranks about the pandemic costing the BJP in elections.\n\nWhile there are still three years to the next Lok Sabha polls (2024), when PM Modi will seek a third term, states like Uttar Pradesh are due to vote next year.\n\nIf the results of the UP Panchayat polls are any indication, the BJP has reason to worry.\n\nThe discontent has floated to the surface. Union Minister Santosh Gangwar's letter to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath flagging oxygen shortage, \"black-marketing\" of medical equipment and delays in admitting Covid patients in his constituency Bareilly went viral.\n\nLeaders say there is a strong belief that any damage control will require a shuffle in which some ministers must go and make way for new faces.\n\nThe Covid emergency has exposed the poor health infrastructure and unpreparedness of the government, leaders admit.\n\nHealth is a state subject but that argument does not wash, they believe, since it is the Centre that had been leading the fight against Covid since last year. \"People are disappointed with the central leadership and they blame lack of action on their part for the current situation, which has gone out of our hands,\" sources said.\n\nPM Modi's campaign in West Bengal while Covid cases were spiraling in the country has sent a \"wrong message\", senior leaders fear. Top BJP leaders were campaigning in West Bengal and attending huge rallies and roadshows without masks, prioritizing votes over public safety, and the imagery across global media could not have been worse.\n\nThese leaders also blame lack of communication within the government. \"The Principal Scientific Adviser K Vijay Raghavan warns us about the third wave but he never talked about the second wave,\" a leader lashed out.\n\nThere is an unsettling perception that the BJP's famed machinery is invisible on the ground, and so are its leaders. They are not seen extending help to people this time, unlike last year when the party organization arranged food packets and other relief during the lockdown.\n\nThe government's mismanagement is also evident in what leaders call a \"botched-up vaccination drive\" tangled in rules and regulations.\n\nVaccine production capacity should have been enhanced when there was time, the leaders point out.\n\nThose in the government have strongly defended the Centre's Covid response. They say the perceived ill-preparedness was mainly because of zero warning about the magnitude of the second wave. \"It is a fact that the government was not prepared for the second wave but now all hands are on the deck,\" a minister said.\n\n\"The oxygen supply is being strengthened. Vaccination drive will be smoother. Our vaccine basket has been increased and we will get more vaccines in the coming months,\" he said, adding that the Prime Minister was personally monitoring the efforts.\n\nPM Modi \"cut short his Bengal campaign as soon as it was brought to his notice\", leaders say, and persuaded seers to wind down the mega Kumbh Mela - a religious gathering on the banks of river Ganga that heightened super-spreader fears.\n\n\"It is understood that people are angry and in pain, but the government is trying its best to extend all possible help. BJP-rules states are in the forefront,\" they say. The Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government, for instance, has launched a special drive in the villages to trace, test and treat on a large scale.\n\nThe leaders accuse opposition-ruled states of \"playing politics\" at this hour of crisis and putting their failure at the door steps of the Centre - they name Delhi and Maharashtra.\n\n\"Despite public health being state subject, the Central government has been proactive in Covid management as a pandemic requires national level coordination and substantial resources,\" Union Minister Prakash Javadekar has written in a column in The Indian Express.",

Politics does not only mean to be in power, but it is social work and nationalism. \u201cWe should stand with society and the poor without thinking about caste, religion or party and help all, which will surely bear fruits for the BJP in the future through this good work,\u201d he said.\n\nGadkari said no one should step out of his or her house without any valid reason and always wear a face mask, maintain social distance and follow all protocols of the pandemic. \u201cYou should first start following these protocols before asking the people to do so through the word of mouth,\u201d he said. Gadkari further said many public representatives and corporators have expressed their desire to open hospitals and COVID centres.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is a very risky work because someone might get infected again\u2026 mistakes may happen while administering injection or oxygen and a huge problem will arise if someone loses life in this process,\u201d he said and advised that the number of beds be increased in the existing hospitals only.\n\n\u201cIt will be better if such COVID centres are opened by the existing hospitals only as they have the required number of doctors, nurses and staff for the purpose,\u201d he added. During his address, Gadkari praised three local BJP workers for helping people by providing them with oxygen cylinders and concentrators.\n\nGadkari also asked the party workers to focus on arranging blood and plasma without holding any blood donation camps. He said blood and plasma can be arranged from donors from their respective wards in limited numbers in blood banks.\n\nGadkari also asked the party workers to arrange well-equiped ambulance services and vehicles for carrying dead bodiesin every district in the Vidarbha region in east Maharashtra. The Nagpur MP appealed to the party workers to arrange for food and medicines for their colleagues who are in need and focus on helping senior citizens with water and other things at vaccination camps.\n\nAppealing to the party workers to not take the pandemic lightly, Gadkari asked them to work through video conferencing and use mobile phones for communication.",

He assured the prime minister that the US and India will work closely together in the fight against COVID-19.\n\n\"Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,\" President Biden had said in a tweet.\n\nReflecting an overwhelming support for a \"natural ally\", the entire country not only the administration, but also the corporate sector which created a global task force, as well as Americans and Indian-Americans have opened their coffers for India.\n\nJust as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need. https://t.co/SzWRj0eP3y \u2014 President Biden (@POTUS) April 25, 2021\n\nThis half a billion dollars includes USD 100 million pledged by the Biden administration, USD 70 million by pharma major Pfizer and 450,000 Remdesivir doses, the governmental purchase price of each of which in the US is USD 390.\n\nThousands of oxygen concentrators and plane loads of life saving drugs and health care equipment are flying off the United States for India almost every day.\n\nSeveral companies like Boeing and Mastercard have announced financial assistance worth USD 10 million each, Google has pledged USD 18 million, which the Global Task Force that comprises CEOs of top American companies have already pledged USD 30 million worth of life saving equipment.\n\nDescribing it as a \"Berlin Life Moment\", Mukesh Aghi of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), told PTI he expects the assistance to touch almost USD 1 billion by the end of the month. \"It is emotional for the diaspora, almost everyone has someone who has been touched by COVID-19,\" he said.\n\nNisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council (USIBC) said, \"The outpouring of support from the United States over the past two weeks was a spontaneous mass mobilisation of support for the Indian people from across the America government, business community and diaspora community and the American people.\"\n\n\"It is unprecedented, and it reflects both the deep bonds between our two countries and the gratitude that Americans feel for the role India played in supporting the United States when we were experiencing our COVID surge last year,\" she said.\n\nHowever, given the \"speed and severity\" that have overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and local authorities, more assistance will be needed and for a sustained period of timescale of the pandemic, Biswal said.\n\nPeople of the country and the Diaspora too have come out in large numbers. Indian-American Vinod Khosla has committed USD 10 million, top corporate leader John T Chambers has promised USD 1 million.\n\nFor the first time in its history, Sewa International has raised USD 15 million; American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) (USD 3.6 million), Indiaspora (USD 2.5) million and Jai Shetty has raised USD 4 million.\n\n\"There has been overwhelming support and offers of assistance from the US Government, private sector, diaspora and the American public at large. In fact, in my interactions in recent days, the US interlocutors across the board ask me, 'tell us what more we can do for India''\", India''s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI.\n\n\"They recall with fondness the help India gave. These are reflective of strong partnership and close people to people ties between our both nations. We deeply appreciate these gestures.

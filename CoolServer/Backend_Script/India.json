Both states are ruled by BJP which makes it imperative for Congress to wrest them from the rival.\n\nBut the stakes are set to be higher because the victory of TMC in West Bengal, DMK in Tamil Nadu and CPM in Kerala has given the impression that the regional parties have managed to shut out an expectant BJP while Congress failed in Assam. While these results have kicked off a chatter about a national anti-BJP front, many in the opposition view Congress as the weak link that is unable to confront the saffron party even though Congress insists it is the principal anti-BJP voice.\n\nIt is felt that Congress will have to demonstrate its ability to take on and tame the BJP - given the bipolar politics of a large swathe spanning MP, Chhattisgarh, HP, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Assam, Karnataka - to earn the respect of the regional forces.\n\nThe tone for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls was set by the Congress sweep of the BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh but the dynamics of the polls changed after the Pulwama attacks, Congressmen regret.\n\nWhile the biggest prize of all, Uttar Pradesh, and Punjab also go to the polls with Goa and Uttarakhand, Congress is not a factor in UP while BJP is absent from the latter. Uttarakhand and Goa would thus be watched for the direct confrontation between the national parties. A stumble there would deal a serious setback to Congress's political positioning.\n\n",

Besides writing the script, in collaboration with Valmiki, she would tell you, smiling, she has also composed the music.\n\n\u201cI was suffering from breathlessness, but the deadline to finish my film was fast approaching. So I sang the track in that condition and mailed it to my musicians,\u201d says Devika. \u201cIt was indeed a severe form of COVID-19 that struck me.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, she had to isolate herself in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol. That experience came in handy when she enacted the role of Ahalya during the shoot of her production.\n\n\u201cI chose the tale of Ahalya for my film because I thought we all could relate, during these tough times, to her isolation and loneliness as she waited for Rama to end her curse,\u201d says Devika. \u201cI interpreted her character from my own perspective rather than those of other poets like Ezhuthachan. After reading different versions of The Ramayana, I went back to the original work by Valmiki.\u201d\n\nThe production, which she has choreographed and performed, is in the Mohiniyattam style, of course. She roped in ace cinematographer Madhu Ambat to shoot the film.\n\nAhalya premieres on shaale.com on May 9.",

In absolute numbers, at least 134 MLAs elected in 2021 faced criminal cases, of whom 57 had criminal cases for offences of a serious nature.\n\nADR\u2019s analysis included only 224 of the 234 MLAs. Details of eight MLAs from the DMK and two from the Congress were not included in the analysis due to lack of availability of proper data, the organisation said.\n\nFor similar reasons, the comparison to 2016 included only 223 of the 234 MLAs, it said.\n\n85% crorepatis\n\nMore than 85% of the elected MLAs are crorepatis, compared to 76% in 2016. Consequently, the analysis showed that the average worth of assets of MLAs increased by nearly 50% from \u20b98.21 crore in 2016 to \u20b912.27 crore in 2021.\n\nE. Subaya of AIADMK, who got elected from Ambasamudram constituency in Tirunelveli district, is the wealthiest candidate with a total worth of \u20b9246 crore. K. Marimuthu of the Communist Party of India, who got elected from Thiruthuraipoondi constituency in Tiruvarur district, is the poorest with assets worth \u20b93.3 lakh.\n\nThis election also saw a marginally higher number of graduates entering the Assembly, compared to 2016. Around 65% of the elected candidates were aged 60 or above, the analysis showed.",

The conversations weren\u2019t forced and veered around the issues of faith, atheism, the Charvaka philosophy and touched on figures such as Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Sree Narayana Guru, even Pope Francis.

Several cities have now followed suit\n\nDivi K wanted to take some home-cooked food for her elderly aunt, who was unwell, on May 1 in Bengaluru. She stays in Halasuru which is about 20 kilometres from her aunt\u2019s house in Yelahanka. Due to the lockdown in Karnataka, she was unable to drive there herself. She could not find a delivery service either. That is when she came across a helpline number for Relief Riders, a group of cyclists who are volunteering to deliver medicines and other essentials, including food, to vulnerable people in the city. Within minutes of dialling the number, a volunteer \u2014 Kunal Bohra, a second-year BCom student \u2014 reached her doorstep. The food was delivered within an hour.\n\nRelief Riders is headed by Bengaluru\u2019s \u2018bicycle mayor\u2019 Sathya Sankaran, who is a part of BYCS, a Dutch social enterprise that heads a worldwide network of international cycle mayors. Along with the Bengaluru cycling community, he formed Relief Riders during the first wave of the pandemic. With the city in the midst of a two-week lockdown, the cyclists returned to volunteer again. Now, more cities have joined the programme.\n\nThe programme kicked off in Chennai from May 3. Felix John, Chennai\u2019s bicycle mayor, says, \u201cWe are aware the situation is much worse than last year. Hence, it\u2019s probably riskier for us to move around. But the people in need of essentials and medicines have also grown which is why we decided to volunteer.\u201d\n\nRelief Riders helplines Bengaluru: 9886491982, 9731905685, 9591975791, 9535554071\n\n9886491982, 9731905685, 9591975791, 9535554071 Chennai: 8939233053, 9840059830, 9840728071\n\n8939233053, 9840059830, 9840728071 Gurugram: 8383940349, 9643002469\n\n8383940349, 9643002469 Hyderabad: 9566170334\n\n9566170334 Mumbai: 8591441671, 9820063141, 9619316254, 9820994495\n\nIn Bengaluru, the team serves from 6 am to 10 am (on other times as well, in case of emergencies) every day. Once a person in need contacts a helpline number, the request is shared on a WhatsApp group. Then, whoever is available to help, takes it up. Volunteers have made about 90 deliveries so far. They also check on people with physical and mental disabilities. The Bengaluru team has tied up with the elders helpline (1090) as well.\n\n\u201cThere are about 190 volunteers in Bangalore and 29 in Hubli-Dharwad,\u201d says Sathya. Five more cities \u2014 Mumbai, Chennai, Gurugram, Hyderabad, and Belagavi \u2014 have joined the programme.\n\nThe Hyderabad edition of Relief Riders, which started on May 1, has done about 10 deliveries so far. \u201cI think the number of requests we get will increase as the helpline numbers are just beginning to reach more people,\u201d says Santhana Selvan, Hyderabad\u2019s bicycle mayor.\n\n\u201cThe disease is now believed to be airborne. So, we are extra careful this time. There are a few guidelines one has to agree before signing up to be a volunteer,\u201d says Sathya.\n\nIn Gurugram, Vineet Chopra and his local cycling group, the Rock Riders, formed a couple of years ago with a bunch of people in his apartment complex, are volunteering under the Relief Riders banner. \u201cWe have been getting about 40 to 50 calls a day, most asking for oxygen cylinders or Remdesivir. Sometimes, whole families are COVID positive, and even the chemist won\u2019t go to these houses,\u201d he says.\n\nPayments are usually cashless. But, occasionally, volunteers help with cash transactions if an elderly person is unfamiliar with digital payments. Santhana Selvan says a volunteer in Hyderabad even paid for medicines as the person in need of it could not afford them. \u201cIt\u2019s really heartening to earn the gratitude of such people,\u201d he adds.\n\nMost of these volunteers who are used to riding long distances operate within neighbourhoods. \u201cWe used to cycle long distances for our own health. We don\u2019t get to ride long distances now. But we ride for the health and safety of others,\u201d says Sathya.\n\n(With inputs from Sunalini Mathew)",

The communal riots in Muzzaffarnagar in 2013, however, saw this support base splinter and his party suffered a major defeat in 2014 without a single seat. In the last year or so his party vigorously campaigned against the three controversial farm laws, an issue which is of concern to agrarian communities over and above communal considerations.\n\nPersonal warmth\n\nFormer colleagues of Mr. Ajit Singh recalled his personal warmth towards them, whatever his political alignment happened to be at a particular time. One of the first calls that former Chief Minister of Karnataka Siddaramaiah made to a Union Minister in Delhi after becoming Chief Minister was to Mr. Ajit Singh, a gesture underlining the fact that it was on a Lok Dal ticket in the 1970s that the former had fought his first election.\n\nBashishstha Narayan Singh, Rajya Sabha MP and former Bihar unit president of the Janata Dal, had been a close associate of both Chaudhary Charan Singh and Mr. Ajit Singh. \u201cWhat stood out with Ajit Singhji was his personal warmth and courtesy to colleagues and former colleagues. I have visited his home and his attitude would be the same warm one, whether you were political fellow travellers at that point or not.\u201d\n\nPM\u2019s tribute\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi also paid tribute to Mr. Ajit Singh stating that the latter was always at the forefront of fighting for the interests of farmers.",

    "Text": "Contrary to expectations, the BJP\u2019s appeal among backward classes and the rural poor has petered out\n\nThe phrase \u2018subaltern Hindutva\u2019 was bandied about quite a lot in academic and journalistic circles during the recently concluded West Bengal Assembly election. Many journalists and scholars covering stories from the field had a common account, that a large section of rural poor, backward classes, Dalits and Adivasis had firmly shifted towards the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the influence of the Hindutva ideology, and that the Trinamool Congress, which owed its rise to the backward classes in 2011, had become extremely unpopular among them. Some described the movement of these subaltern classes towards the BJP as cultural and political solidarity among Hindus and also a reflection of the dominance of \u2018anti-Bhadralok\u2019 (anti-upper caste/class) sentiments in rural areas that the Trinamool Congress had once benefited from.\n\nThe post-poll survey data, however, suggest that both the subaltern and bhadralok shift that had taken place towards the BJP on a massive scale in the 2019 Lok Sabha election waned this time and the Trinamool Congress managed to retain much of its lost support among these sections.\n\nData show that the decline in support for the BJP compared to the Lok Sabha election was the steepest among OBC communities (Yadavs, Kurmis, Kumhars, Lohars, Telis, etc., taken together), falling from over two-thirds (68%) to just half (49%) this time around. Like OBC voters, Adivasi voters, too, were far less enthused by the BJP, and their support fell drastically from 62% to 46%. Most of them made their way back to the Trinamool, which also explains why the ruling party regained lost ground in some of the State\u2019s tribal areas and Scheduled Tribes-reserved seats.\n\nErosion of Dalit support\n\nAmong Dalit communities, too, on whom the BJP invested considerable time and energy this time, the party was simply unable to retain the huge level of support it had garnered two years ago, and much of this was due to the erosion of the Rajbanshi support. The BJP\u2019s vote share among Rajbanshis declined from three-fourths in 2019 to three-fifths this time. This is counter-intuitive since the BJP did well in north Bengal, but the survey data suggest that it was more on account of support from groups other than Rajbanshis and other communities. The only segment of Dalits that the BJP was able to hold on to were the Namashudras (including Matua refugees), but among them, too, the party managed to make only meagre progress, and even that was limited to certain regions. In fact, for the BJP to have had any chance at defeating the Trinamool Congress, it needed to build on its 2019 base among Dalits as a whole. Far from it, it ended up losing some of them.\n\nFinally, as far as the upper castes (Brahmins, Kayasthas, Baidyas, etc.) are concerned, the story for the BJP was no different. Among them, too, the party registered some losses instead of making any gains, falling from 50% in 2019 to 46% this time. However, this modest loss of upper-caste support should not be misinterpreted as a loss of upper-class support for the BJP. Our data do not find them to be synonymous. The BJP actually led the Trinamool Congress by a good 13 and 14 percentage points among upper-class and middle-class Hindus, respectively. It faced some tough competition among the backward classes and the poorest Hindus \u2014 the party\u2019s vote share among the poorest Hindus registered a massive 17-percentage-point decline compared to 2019.\n\nThe author is a Research Associate at Lokniti-CSDS, Delhi",

Some models have it [second wave] going out in early June. Based on what we are seeing now, middle to end of May would be a reasonable estimate.\u201d\n\nThe United States will support an initiative at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to waive Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) protection for COVID-19 vaccines, the Biden administration said on Wednesday. The news will support the increased production of vaccines globally as countries, including India, continue to reel under the impact of the pandemic. The initiative was first floated by India and South Africa last October.\n\nWith India\u2019s economic recovery threatened by the COVID-19 second wave, the Reserve Bank of India stepped in on Wednesday with measures aimed at alleviating any financing constraints for healthcare infrastructure and services, as well as small borrowers who may be facing distress due to a sudden spike in health expenditure.\n\nCumulatively, India has received (from April 27 to May 4) 1,764 oxygen concentrators, 1,760 oxygen cylinders, seven oxygen generation plants, 450 ventilators and more than 1.35 lakh Remdesivir vials and 1.20 lakh Favipiravir strips, said the Health Ministry on Wednesday.\n\nThere is no denying that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has massively increased its vote and seat share in West Bengal compared to the 2016 Assembly election, and this has largely been on the back of a strong Hindu consolidation behind it (50%), as per the Lokniti-CSDS\u2019s post-poll survey.\n\nQuestioning the silence of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on the post-election attacks directed at the BJP workers, party national president J.P.

VijayRaghavan, principal scientific adviser to the Government of India, has warned. There was need to update the COVID-19 vaccines to deal with the new strains and mutations. \u201cThere is, however, no clear time-line on when this third phase will occur. We should be prepared for new waves and COVID appropriate behaviour and vaccine upgrades is the way forward,\u201d he said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday shot off another letter to the West Bengal government, saying no steps had been taken yet to abate the post-poll violence in the State.\n\nGermany is sending a massive oxygen plant on loan to Delhi on Thursday, capable of generating 4,00,000 litres of oxygen.

    "Text": "Election after election, women voters have continued to ally themselves with Mamata Banerjee\u2019s party\n\nOf the various factors that contributed to the Trinamool Congress\u2019s victory in the Assembly election, the support of women voters for Mamata Banerjee is significant. And this is not new for this election \u2014 even in polls held during the last decade, women have always come out in support of Mamata Banerjee. Not only have women voters managed to bridge the turnout deficit vis-\u00e0-vis men, but their voting preferences have also been different. For the fourth straight election in the State (counting both Assembly and Lok Sabha elections), women voted for the Trinamool in higher proportions than men.\n\nAccording to the Lokniti-CSDS post-poll survey, the gender gap this time was to the tune of four percentage points, slightly lower than in the past, but still significantly large. While 46% of men voted for the Trinamool Congress, two points lower than the party\u2019s average vote share, among women voters, support for the Trinamool Congress touched 50%. This higher-than-average voting for the Trinamool among women also meant that the ruling party got a far bigger advantage over its principal opponent, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), among women than men. For men, the Trinamool Congress was ahead of the BJP by six percentage points, and among women, the Trinamool\u2019s lead over the BJP was twice as high at a massive 13 percentage points.\n\nWomen voters seem to have been instrumental in driving up the Trinamool Congress\u2019s seat numbers. A somewhat similar trend was witnessed in the 2016 Assembly election, when the Left Front-Congress alliance had trailed behind the Trinamool Congress by just two percentage points among men voters but by 12 percentage points among women.\n\nThe question that arises is, what has attracted women voters towards Mamata Banerjee election after election? It seems that many welfare schemes specifically targeted at women, like Kanyashree, Rupashree or bicycles for girl students, that the Mamata Banerjee-government launched during its tenure, may well have enhanced her popularity among women voters. Further, the fact that Ms. Banerjee has given greater representation to women in her party and government could also be making her more popular amongst women. This election saw the Trinamool Congress giving tickets to as many as 50 women, five more than the 2016 election.\n\nA number of schemes\n\nAnother possible explanation for the Trinamool doing exceedingly well among women voters this time could be the party\u2019s election manifesto promise that it would provide a minimum monthly income to the woman head of every family \u2014 \u20b9500 for those from the general category and \u20b91,000 for those from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and OBC families. The Trinamool\u2019s vote share among Dalit women was five percentage points more than it was among Dalit men, seven points more among upper-caste women, and 13 points more among Adivasi women.\n\nAnother category of women that particularly stood out in its support for the Trinamool this time was that of elderly women aged 45 years and above. Over half of them voted for the Trinamool and only some, about a third, opted for the BJP. Women from the poorest backgrounds also emerged as Trinamool\u2019s strong supporters. Interestingly, the only category of women that ended up siding more with the BJP than the Trinamool in this election was that of upper-class women.\n\nThe author is co-director of the Lokniti programme at CSDS",

Day to day, we are getting information from our biomedical department that vendors are supplying at the last minute. We are expecting severe oxygen shortage in Chennai within the next 10 to 15 days. Unless we can bring down the active cases by way of a lockdown, it is going to be a supply versus demand problem.\u201d\n\n\u2018Situation may worsen\u2019\n\nThough there was no oxygen shortage right now, hospitals are receiving supply at the last minute, he said, adding, \u201cThe situation is all set to worsen. We are anticipating a shortage of oxygen in the future. We are trying to rationalise our use of oxygen and procure oxygen concentrators for ward patients. The best concentrators can give eight to 10 litres of oxygen. Anybody with a higher requirement cannot be managed with concentrators.\u201d\n\nAn official at a hospital, on the condition of anonymity, said, \u201cIt is a nail-biting wait for the truck.\u201d\n\nOn average, the hospital has 150 to 170 patients on oxygen support. \u201cTrucks to refill the liquid oxygen tanks do not come on time, putting pressure on us. Delay will send patients into desaturation. So, we are not taking too many patients requiring oxygen. We can take more if we have more supply,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe government should ensure that oxygen supply is increased and Remdesivir is available for private hospitals. Non-availability of Remdesivir is a setback. We have to send the patients\u2019 attenders with a prescription to government medical college hospitals to get Remdesivir,\u201d the official said.\n\nSanty Sajan, chief operating officer, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, in a written reply to The Hindu, said, \u201cWe are grateful to the State authorities and local associates for ensuring regular and timely supplies of oxygen for the smooth running of operations at all our hospitals. We are closely monitoring the requirement of oxygen and other essential supplies as we enhance our critical bed capacity for extending care to our patients.\u201d\n\nP. Ramakrishnan, State president of the Indian Medical Association - Tamil Nadu, said that with the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, more admissions were expected. \u201cThere is a need for uninterrupted and prompt supply of oxygen for private hospitals. If the supply is increased, we will be trouble-free,\u201d he said.\n\nAvailability of beds, Remdesivir and vaccines were among the other issues facing hospitals. At one hospital, all COVID-19 beds \u2014 wards, intensive care and holding area in the emergency room \u2014 were full. \u201cWe have another 50 to 60 patients requiring intensive care and ventilator-supported beds waiting, and another 50 to 60 patients in the waiting list for ward beds,\u201d a hospital authority said.\n\n\u201cWe are unable to accommodate many patients. Our doctors, nurses and other staff and equipment are stretched out to take care of these many beds. Anything beyond will stretch our resources. Most of the doctors are heading for a burnout,\u201d he added.\n\nDr. Gnanasekaran said Chennai would require at least 1,000 more ward beds and at least 200 more intensive care beds with all necessary equipment and manpower to handle the crisis for the next two months. \u201cOur only hope is a lockdown for Chennai for at least 20 days, like in Maharashtra, to bring down the transmission,\u201d he said.\n\nVaccination had come to a standstill in some private hospitals. The government should ensure that vaccination is carried out in full swing, a senior doctor said.\n\nMs. Sajan pointed out that they have ensured that currently over 50% of beds were dedicated for COVID care and they were geared up to further step up if required.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), India has a total of 20.6 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and over 226,000 deaths.Countries across the South Asia region are witnessing rises in infections, with India accounting for over 90 per cent of both cases and deaths in the region, according to the World Health Organisation India also accounted for 46 per cent of global cases and 25 per cent of global deaths reported in the past week, WHO added.UNICEF Regional Director for South Asia George Laryea-Adjei said in a statement that urgent action and steadfast leadership are indispensable to stop the catastrophe.\"Governments must do everything within their power to stop the devastation, and partners that can send assistance must do so immediately. The international community must step up without delay,\" Laryea-Adjei said.\"This is not just a moral imperative. The deadly new surge in South Asia threatens us all. It has the potential to reverse hard-earned global gains against the pandemic if not halted as soon as possible,\" Laryea-Adjei added.Unicef said the \"scenes we are witnessing in South Asia\" are unlike anything the region has seen before.\"Family members of patients are pleading for help as the region reels under an acute shortage of medical-grade oxygen. Exhausted health workers are being pushed to the brink of collapse. We are faced with a real possibility that our health systems will be strained to a breaking point - leading to even more loss of life.\"Laryea-Adjei said the very low levels of vaccination in South Asia magnify the likelihood of the virus spiralling even further out of control. In almost all countries in the region, except for the Maldives and Bhutan, fewer than 1 in 10 people have been vaccinated.\"Now more than ever, we must ensure vaccines equitably reach all populations. Manufacturing must be ramped up, technology transferred, and doses equitably shared. None of us is safe until all of us are safe,\" Laryea-Adjei said.Laryea-Adjei said the first wave of the pandemic caused drastic cuts in the availability and use of essential public health services in South Asia, costing the lives of an estimated 228,000 children and 11,000 mothers.\"We simply cannot let this happen again. We must do everything within our power to keep essential health, immunization and nutrition services running - and make sure women and children everywhere feel safe to use them. Viruses know no borders. We must come together now as a global community to stop the devastation and protect our children.\"The UN agency said it has provided oxygen concentrators and other critically needed emergency equipment to support the immediate response in the country, while also supporting resilience-building against recurrent shocks and stresses to the health system that leave children and their families at risk.Unicef has supplied 85 Covid-19 testing machines, which form a crucial part of the Government of India's response to the pandemic.Additionally, Unicef is supporting the procurement and installation of 25 oxygen plants for hospitals in the Northeast and Maharashtra , and the installation of more than 70 thermal scanners at various ports of entry countrywide.Since the start of the pandemic, Unicef has also been working with the government and partners in India to help stop the spread of Covid-19, sharing information with more than 660 million people on how to stay safe from the coronavirus.It has consistently worked to counter misinformation and promote Covid-19 protective practices, including wearing masks, physical distancing, and handwashing.Unicef said it needs $21 million for the urgent delivery of additional testing equipment, supplies and oxygen products in India, and more than $50 million for lifesaving Covid-19 interventions across sectors.Unicef said end-to-end logistics support from DP World helped the equipment was dispatched from Unicef's warehouse in Dubai to New Delhi to help India battle the deadly wave of Covid-19.DP World Group Chairman and CEO Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem said the company partnered with Unicef because dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic is \"humanity's biggest logistics challenge in living memory.\"\"This emergency shipment of medical supplies is just one of many operations DP World will be supporting worldwide. The UAE and India have strong ties, and we stand by India through this devastating pandemic,\" he said.",

    "Text": "DELHI/ LONDON: The pandemic situation in India made another round of global headlines Wednesday after 2 members of foreign minister S Jaishankar-led delegation at G7 were reported to have tested positive in London. Official government sources here said though that this wasn\u2019t a \" straightforward case of coming in with infected people\" and that all members of the delegation were reported negative by Covid tests carried out 48 hours before they embarked on the May 3-6 visit to the UK.The 4-member delegation, including Jaishankar and, went into \"self-isolation\" after the minister was informed by UK authorities of \"possible\" exposure to the virus. All members were tested after they landed in London. As he himself announced in a tweet, Jaishankar participated virtually in what was the first physical meeting of the G7 foreign ministers in 2 years. India was at the meeting as a special invitee. Jaishankar himself was not among the 2 said to have tested positive.\"Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid positive cases. As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well,\" tweeted the minister. Among the dignitaries with whom Jaishankar had a meeting in person in the past few days were US secretary of state Antony Blinken and UK home secretary Priti Patel British officials were quoted as saying that the isolation of the Indian officials was in keeping with the strictly laid out protocol for the G7 meeting that required daily testing of the attendees. However, while UK authorities insisted that 2 officials had tested positive, official sources here hinted there might be a mismatch between the Covid-19 protocols followed by the 2 countries.There are now question marks also over the return of the delegation from the UK. Local Covil protocol requires a person to self-isolate for 10 days if he or she has tested positive or if the person has come in contact with anybody who has Covid. While sources in London said the return would depend on Indian authorities, the fact that the delegation flew commercial could complicate things.Sources in the UK pointed to Jaishankar\u2019s tweet when asked if his meeting with his counterpart Dominic Raab at Chevening on Thursday will also be held in virtual mode.\"One thing for sure is that no infected person would have been allowed to travel with the minister. The delegation members were tested not 72 hours, but 48 hours before the departure,\" claimed a source, adding that the government was in touch with UK authorities on the issue. Public Health England had waived the need to self-isolate for those participating in G7 meetings as these were being held with strong social distancing measures.",

    "Text": "CHENNAI: Eleven Covid-19 patients died gasping for breath after midnight on Wednesday at Chengalpet Government Medical College Hospital as pressure in the oxygen lines dropped suddenly, possibly because of a faulty valve.Earlier, on Tuesday afternoon, pressure had dropped in a similar fashion, leaving two patients dead. Pressure had been restored immediately and normal supply resumed. But around midnight, the pressure dropped again drastically and within two hours, 11 people had died.A patient in the ICU said he watched helplessly as a woman two beds away struggled for breath and passed away. \"The fear that you could be next is the worst thing that can happen to anyone,\" he said.Hospital authorities said they had replaced a coil near the main valve of the oxygen pipelines last week and consumption had nearly doubled ever since, even when there was no increase in the number of patients.Witnesses said doctors and nurses rushed around trying to save children and adults using handheld devices and portable oxygen cylinders. They also had to face frantic relatives of patients, who insisted their people be attended to first. Amid the chaos, pressure was restored by 2am. The hospital had 447 patients on Tuesday and almost 70% required oxygen support.Chengalpet district collector A John Louis said oxygen consumption almost doubled on Tuesday compared to the usual levels and continuous efforts were taken to ensure that supply was not interrupted. He has ordered an investigation. \u201cOxygen supply was not interrupted at the hospital. I was there on the field last night and personally monitored the situation,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, duty doctors at the hospital staged a protest within the premises on Wednesday morning. \u201cRelatives of people who choked to death were furious with us and no one came to our aid between midnight and 2am,\u201d said one of them. Protesting doctors said they were shortstaffed and overburdened.The hospital has Covid patients on eight different floors in three buildings. Each floor is managed by one doctor and a maximum of two nurses. \u201cSo it becomes difficult to handle the situation even when two patients need immediate medical attention,\u201d a duty doctor told TOI, requesting anonymity.",

    "Text": "NEW DELHI: The Union government on Wednesday informed the Supreme Court that Delhi has got higher per capita oxygen allocation as compared to similarly placed other states and asserted that a uniform pan-India approach has to be adopted in disbursement of oxygen depending on the caseload.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta informed a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah that per capita allocation of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) to Delhi, that is allocation against number of active cases, is higher compared to any other similarly placed States.\"As against the active cases of 96,747 as on May 1, allocation to GNCT is 590 MT LMO, which translates to 60.98 litres per patient. The per capita allocation of States having high active caseload - Kerala (6.42), Tamil Nadu (18.74), Chhattisgarh (18.74), Haryana (25.07), Maharashtra (27.09), Andhra Pradesh (36.71), Telangana (53.29), is therefore, far less.\"The Centre in its affidavit before the SC on Wednesday said active cases in Delhi have begun to show a declining trend from 1,03,424 on April 28 to 92,290 on May 3. The dip in cases should also be factored while demands are made by the Delhi government.The Centre presented the forecast for the requirement of LMO for various states, which mostly showed a higher trend. Maharashtra's requirement on May 5 was 1,804 MT against 2,000 MT on April 30; UP 894 (800); Karnataka 865 (111); Gujarat 975 (1200); Delhi 590 (490); Punjab 257 (82); Kerala 208 (104); Tamil Nadu 404 (465); Madhya Pradesh 649 (700); Rajasthan 380 (124); Chhattisgarh 227 (382); Haryana 257 (180). It also projected demands for other states as on May 5 - Telangana 480 MT; West Bengal 308; Bihar 214 and Uttarakhand 123.The Centre said, \"allocation is a zero-sum game: any change in increasing the supply of one state would have a cascading impact on others wherein, like Delhi, the need of oxygen is rising sharply. Therefore, the need for oxygen is to be balanced, optimised and judiciously distributed at a national level, with a national outlook.\"It said no other state has complained about allocated quantity falling short of the requirement, except Delhi where the problem appears to be systemic problem in the last mile delivery. The Centre said, \"It is critical to note that 17 Additional tankers/ISO containers have also been allotted for use in Delhi with a total capacity of 331 MTs LMO. Over and above the same, the Air Force also provided 31 sorties between April 26 to May 4 for Delhi, where 20 oxygen tankers were lifted with a total capacity of 457 MTs LMO.\"",

We will continue to work with all stakeholders in the US to collectively fight the global pandemic including through equitable distribution of affordable vaccines for global public health at this critical juncture,\u201d Sandhu said in response to a question.In the past few months, the Indian Embassy had made a focused outreach on the need for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines in the developing world.The embassy methodically reached out to the members of the House and Senate . This was reflected in the series of letters that the US lawmakers wrote to President Biden in support.In recent months, Sandhu has spoken on this issue to Senators Ed Markey and Raphael Warnock; Congresswoman Katherine Clark, Assistant Speaker; Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chair of House Foreign Affairs Committee; Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, Chair of the Progressive Caucus; Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky and Congressman Ro Khanna.A joint outreach was also undertaken with the South African Embassy in Washington DC and together, the two envoys had underscored the importance of the issue with Congresswoman Karen Bass, Chair House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health.",

However, people in coastal regions would experience sultry weather due to the high humidity levels as in 70% at Nungambakkam.\n\nIn its bulletin, the Meteorological Department has said the humidity level hovered between 50% and 90% over the coastal and adjoining districts. People may experience a \u201creal feel\u201d temperature that is likely to be more than the normal by four or five degree Celsius.\n\nOfficials of the Meteorological Department said that a trough or wind discontinuity, a line across which there would be an abrupt change in wind direction, would spark up thunderstorms with light to moderate rains in few places over Western Ghats, interior and southern parts of Tamil Nadu till May 8. Thundershowers may be restricted to Western Ghats till the weekend.\n\nIn 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. Wednesday, Suralacode in Kanniyakumari district and Sankarankoil in Tenkasi district received 7 cm of rains each.\n\nN. Puviarasan, Director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai, said a cyclonic circulation over the Comorin area and the neighbourhood would influence pre-monsoon showers over parts of the State.\n\nRecalling the heat wave period during early April, he said wind direction was a major determining factor for rise or fall in day temperature.\n\nAnticyclone system\n\nAn anticyclone, a weather phenomenon that has winds in clockwise direction slowly blowing around it, is prevailing over the Bay of Bengal. This had been pushing cool, moist east-southeasterly winds into the Tamil Nadu region and keeping maximum temperature close to average.\n\nHowever, there may be a rise in mercury level after May 10 as this system may disappear and the anticyclone over Arabian sea bringing in westerly winds would persist. As the hot westerlies are expected to blow across the inland, temperature was set to rise, officials said.\n\nThe Meteorological Department forecasts that the maximum and minimum temperature will be around 36 degree Celsius and 28 degree Celsius respectively in Chennai till Friday.",

Compared to 2019, Hindus moved away from the BJP and Muslims\u2019 consolidation behind Trinamool strengthened further Voted for Trinamool Voted for BJP 2016 2019 2021 2016 2019 2021 Hindu 43 32 39 12 57 50 Muslim 51 70 75 6 4 7\n\nThe Trinamool Congress was a direct beneficiary of this erosion of votes, with the party registering an increase in Hindu support from 32% in 2019 to 39% this time. This seven-percentage-point shift from the BJP to the Trinamool happened despite the former running a high-pitched Hindutva campaign that was aimed at exciting Hindus through Jai Shri Ram slogans, talk of illegal migration, allegations of \u2018Muslim appeasement\u2019 against the ruling party, and anti-Muslim dog whistles, such as raising the spectre of West Bengal becoming a \u2018mini-Pakistan\u2019 and calling Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee \u2018begum\u2019 and \u2018khala\u2019.\n\nThe post-poll survey conducted by Lokniti-CSDS and data from our study after the 2019 Lok Sabha election together point to the story of limited Hindu consolidation. This has also to do with the way the Hindu mind in West Bengal seems to be working at the moment.\n\nAlso Read West Bengal Assembly Elections | Women rally behind Trinamool\n\nIn our 2019 survey, we asked respondents in West Bengal (and the rest of the country) a set of questions to gauge their views on secularism, the temple-mosque dispute and minority rights. Surprisingly, despite political polarisation, full-fledged communalisation had not occurred in the State, as it was found that many Hindus, including those who voted for the BJP, gave highly secular and pluralistic answers to most of these questions, and far more so than their counterparts in other regions of the country.\n\nFor instance, on a question on the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition, only one in every five Hindus in Bengal had said that demolition was justified, as opposed to two-fifths in the rest of the country. Similarly, a huge majority of Hindus in Bengal (81%) held that India is a country of all religions, and not just Hindus. The same figure among Hindus in the rest of the country was 74%.\n\nimage/svg+xml \u201c1992 Babri Masjid demolition was..\u201d Hindus (West Bengal) Hindus (All India) Justifed 21 39 Not Justifed 42 32 No response 37 29 \u201cIndia belongs to..\u201d Only Hindus 8 17 To all religions equally, not only Hindus 81 74 No response 11 9 \u201cMinorities should get..\u201d Special Treatment 32 50 Equal and not special treatment 29 29 No response 39 21 Note: Figures are percentages and may not add up to 100 due to rounding 2. Did the BJP misjudge the Bengali Hindu mind? Evidence from 2019\n\nOn the issue of protecting minority rights, 38% of Hindus in West Bengal agreed with the proposition that even if it is not liked by the majority community, the government must protect the interests of minorities. This sentiment, in fact, strengthened further to 58% this time, when we repeated this question in our survey.\n\nAlso read: Subaltern Hindutva on the wane in West Bengal?\n\nWhat these responses indicate is that even as average Bengali Hindus may have supported the BJP in large numbers in 2019, the reasons for doing so were different and not necessarily an endorsement of the BJP\u2019s Hindutva agenda. This perhaps explains why the BJP\u2019s support among Hindu voters declined this time instead of increasing. Heavily polarising rhetoric by the BJP in the recent election may well have alienated the liberal tolerant section of the Bengali Hindus from the BJP, particularly the traditional Left voters, who had shown interest in the party in 2019. It also seems to have had the effect of scaring Muslims who consolidated in even larger proportions (75%) behind the Trinamool Congress than they had in 2019. The Trinamool, thus, ended up benefiting both ways.\n\nimage/svg+xml Should the State government get another chance? \u201cThe Mamata Banerjee government gives undue favour to Muslims\u201d % HOW THEY VOTED Trinamool BJP Hindus who fully agreed with the statement 36 18 72 Hindus who somewhat agreed 32 45 41 Hindus who somewhat disagreed 4 68 25 Hindus who fully disagreed 11 70 19 No response 17 45 42 Note: Figures are percentages, the rest of the voters voted for other parties and candidates. 3. Even as most Hindus agreed that the Mamata Banerjee government had favored Muslims unduly, many of them still voted for the Trinamool Congress, particularly those who agreed only partially\n\nThe story, of course, has another side. There is some traction to the idea that the government accorded undue favours to minorities. While a majority of the Hindus in the rest of the country had no problem with it, in West Bengal, the support for the idea was lukewarm, with many being ambivalent on the issue. In fact, in the 2021 survey, most Hindus, even the ones who ended up voting for the Trinamool Congress, agreed with the proposition that the party had given undue favours to Muslims during its tenure, an issue that the BJP had raised. It is nonetheless interesting that many of them continued to vote for the Trinamool despite holding this view.\n\nNone of this is to say that there was no polarisation on religious lines in this election. But the divide was mostly restricted to seats where the Muslim population was higher in proportion. It is also important to note that the Hindu share in the Trinamool\u2019s votes was 57% this time and the Muslim share was 42%; in 2019, it had been 50% for each.\n\nimage/svg+xml Voted for Trinamool Voted for BJP Hindu vote choice in seats with... Muslims <10% population 43 42 Muslim 10-19% 42 46 Muslims 20-29% 26 68 Muslims 30-39% 40 53 Muslim 40%+ 24 65 Muslims <10% population 74 20 Muslim 10-19% 87 3 Muslims 20-29% 70 13 Muslims 30-39% 84 5 Muslim 40%+ 72 6 Note: Figures are percentages, the rest of the voters voted for other parties. 4. Hindus tended to vote more for the BJP in seats with higher proportion of Muslims, but the battle for the Hindu vote was neck and neck elsewhere Muslim vote choice in seats with...\n\nIn sum, the BJP, which prides itself on knowing the Hindu mind, may have failed spectacularly in deciphering the Bengali Hindu psyche. It has been unable to transform the majority community into a minority-hating monolith.\n\nMoreover, the majority community was also divided on the basis of caste, class, gender and other social identities, and the Hindutva campaign clearly fell short in catering to everyday concerns around development and livelihood. In the cultural rubric of Bengal\u2019s politics, there was limited room for uni-dimensional religious polarisation, a fact that the BJP took very lightly.\n\nSuprio Basu is with the Department of Sociology, University of Kalyani; Jyotiprasad Chatterjee is Associate Professor of Sociology at Barrackpore Rastraguru Surendranath College; Shreyas Sardesai is a Research Associate at Lokniti-CSDS, Delhi; Suhas Palshikar is the Co-Director of the Lokniti programme",

The bad news is it won\u2019t be only the new version of the pathogen to emerge from an outbreak of this scale, underscoring the urgency of mapping other possible variants that may be currently racing through India\u2019s tightly-packed population of 1.4 billion people.\n\nAs infections surge by more than 300,000 cases for 14 straight days, pushing India\u2019s tally past 20 million, the country\u2019s limited ability to track new mutations emerging from its outbreak is a growing concern for scientists.\n\nSecond- or even third-generation versions of the variant known as B.1.617 could already be circulating in India and some may be more dangerous, said William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor who now chairs think tank Access Health International.\n\n\u201cIndia has the necessary genome sequencing capabilities but it needs to have a mass surveillance program,\u201d Haseltine said. \u201cI\u2019ll be on the lookout for more and newer variants, given the opportunity the virus has had with such a massive outbreak.\u201d\n\nVariants are already outracing vaccination progress in many parts of the world, fueling bigger outbreaks that spread faster.

Fearing an influx of infections and mindful of B.1.617, Singapore, the U.K. and Tanzania are among countries that have curbed travel to and from India.\n\nAustralia has banned its citizens from returning from India and imposed penalties of roughly $50,000 and five years imprisonment for violators.\n\nThe India strain has been called a double mutant because of the presence of two changes in the virus\u2019s genome, called E484Q and L452R. Both affect a portion of the spike protein, called the receptor binding domain, that\u2019s key to the virus entering cells.\n\nSome researchers estimate that the B.1.617 variant is as transmissible as the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the U.K., thought to be as much as 70% more transmissible than earlier versions of the virus.\n\nYet initial analyses indicate that the India version, now classified a variant of interest by the World Health Organization, poses a limited threat and doesn\u2019t appear to be more dangerous.\n\nCovaxin, the inactivated-virus vaccine being made by India\u2019s Bharat Biotech International Ltd., and AstraZeneca Plc\u2019s vaccine, called Covishield in India, are effective against the strain in preventing serious illness, said Rakesh Mishra, director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, one of the labs analyzing virus samples. Data is still being gathered about the response to Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, Mishra said, but it\u2019s likely to be effective.\n\nBioNTech SE Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he was confident the mRNA shot it\u2019s making with partner Pfizer Inc. would work against the India mutant though testing is still ongoing. \u201cThe Indian variant has the same mutation that we\u2019ve already investigated and against which our vaccine was also effective,\u201d he said last week.\n\nSingapore, which tightened social distancing restrictions this week after findings cases linked to the India variant, has also seen vaccines hold up well to prevent serious illness, said Kenneth Mak, director of medical services in city-state\u2019s health ministry. But \u201cvaccination does not prevent you from getting infected 100%,\u201d he said in a Tuesday briefing.\n\nRavindra Gupta\u2019s team at the University of Cambridge recently studied the two mutations that appear on the receptor binding domain of the India variant\u2019s spike protein. The team tested viruses made to simulate the variant against serum from nine people who had already received a single dose of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to know whether this double mutant really is a double whammy,\u201d said Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge\u2019s Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases. What they found was that while each of the mutations could partly evade neutralizing antibodies, the two mutations didn\u2019t combine to create an even greater ability to evade immune protection.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t combine to make a super mutant,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cIt kind of debunks this view that this double mutant is doubly evading neutralizing antibodies.\u201d\n\nWhile the findings ease concerns around B.1.617, researchers are turning to the next set of variants as India\u2019s outbreak continues to rage. Genomic surveillance can provide crucial information on the new forms of this shape-shifting virus \u2014 critical in preventing subsequent waves and developing the next generation of vaccines.\n\nIn the U.S., recent studies published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that a variant that caused concern when it emerged in New York isn\u2019t more dangerous than earlier strains, while a pair of mutants that surfaced in southern California \u201cmight more frequently cause discernible and severe illness than do nationally circulating lineages overall.\u201d\n\nThe WHO has been monitoring variants through a global working group of laboratories, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the agency\u2019s technical lead officer. Information about new variants is coming in \u201cfast and furious,\u201d she said.\n\nBut as its health system is stretched to breaking point and Prime Minister Narendra Modi resists calls for a lockdown, the country\u2019s labs are ill-equipped to keep up with the necessary monitoring. Genomic sequencing that can identify new strains and track their progress is still relatively sparse in India, where only about 11,000 viruses have been analyzed, according to Mishra.\n\nWhile countries like the U.K. monitor about 5% to 10% of cases, in India far fewer are sequenced. To do so would require analyzing tens of thousands of samples daily, and failing to leaves a huge blind spot, according to Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health in Rhode Island.\n\n\u201cWhat genomic surveillance does,\u201d he said, \u201cis it helps you really track where infections are going and how things are spreading in a way India was pretty blind to.\u201d",

    "Text": "As coronavirus cases continue to spiral in India and hospitals are stretched beyond breaking point, a group of school students from across the country are working around the clock to help Covid-19 patients in critical condition.\n\nEarly in April, Class 12 students Tia Garg and Suhani Daruka received a frantic phone call from a peer in desperate search of an ICU bed for a Covid positive family friend, whose condition was quickly worsening. With the help of a crowdsourced database, set up by the two girls and a dedicated team of volunteers, they were able to locate a free ICU bed within hours.\n\nIt was in that moment Tia and Suhani, students of DPS Vasant Kunj in Delhi, realised that they were onto something big. \u201cWe saw that our database saved someone\u2019s life and it was just our first or second day working on it. That was when we knew we weren\u2019t just putting out information. We were actually affecting lives,\u201d Tia, 17, told the indianexpress.com.\n\nIn November last year, the two teenagers, both avid debaters, launched an online youth forum called \u2018Uncut\u2019 \u2014 a platform for young people, who like them were housebound amid the coronavirus pandemic, to discuss current affairs, politics and popular culture. But when the second wave struck and thousands were turning to social media in search of oxygen cylinders, plasma and medication, the \u2018Uncut\u2019 team decided to shift their focus to Covid relief work.\n\nSince then, they have been able to assist hundreds of Covid patients in distress with the help of expansive state-wise databases, updated and verified almost \u201cevery hour\u201d by a 55-member team of volunteers who work in shifts through the day. The team has also launched a 24-hour volunteer helpline on Instagram, where they have been connecting Covid patients and their loved ones with verified medical resources.\n\nBetween online classes, preparing for their board exams and manning their 24\u00d77 Covid helpline, the members of team \u2018Uncut\u2019 have not slept for more than \u201cfour hours a day,\u201d Tia said. \u201cSince school is off at the moment, we have been scheduling shifts around our tuition classes.\u201d While new resources are constantly added to the database, they are verified by the team only until 8 pm every day. \u201cAfter that, nobody really takes our calls,\u201d explained Shivanshi Chandna, head of PR at project Uncut.\n\nTeam Uncut has set up state-wise crowdsourced databases, which are regularly updated through the day. (Screengrab: Team Uncut has set up state-wise crowdsourced databases, which are regularly updated through the day. (Screengrab: https://www.theuncutteam.com/resources\n\n\u201cAll of our members have been divided into teams based on the state for which they are maintaining a database,\u201d Shivanshi said. \u201cSo they are constantly tracking WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, finding leads for medical resources and verifying them.\u201d\n\nWhen the group\u2019s social media handles were flooded with requests for Covid relief earlier this month, they decided to \u201coutsource\u201d their Instagram helpline. They shared a form on the photo-sharing app, inviting student volunteers to pitch in and support their initiative. \u201cAt least 50-55 people from across the country got in touch. We then set up a new account specifically for Covid relief. So the volunteers are solely working on responding to DMs on that account,\u201d Shivanshi said.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Covid Volunteers (@volunteers.covihelp)\n\nThe team found that people in distress are often unable to scour through all the databases available on the Uncut website themselves. Instead, the team\u2019s volunteers pitch in to call the numbers listed in the database on behalf of the Covid patient, until they are able to find a viable lead.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have gotten in touch with us and thanked us for helping them. We have reviewed messages from people saying that they got a bed only because of us. We keep posting their messages on the volunteer group to encourage them to keep working,\u201d Shivanshi said.\n\nBut not everyone who reached out to Team Uncut had the same luck. While the volunteers continue to work hard to connect Covid patients with potentially life-saving medical resources, the sheer number of requests they receive on a daily basis makes it nearly impossible for them to help everyone who gets in touch. When this happens, the team tries not to get too discouraged and focuses on the bigger picture.\n\n\u201cIt is very disheartening, but at the same time we know that we are doing as much as we can,\u201d Shivanshi said.",

But these observations did not make it to the final order, which said \"at no cost can counting become a catalyst for a further surge\".\n\nThe Election Commission last week approached the Supreme Court against what it called \"blatantly disparaging remarks\" and said the media should be stopped from reporting observations. It also said it was the government under the Disaster Management Authority that had to manage the rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Chief Minister (E Palaniswami) and \"they committed the breach\".\n\nThe Supreme Court said: \"Something is observed in the larger public interest.

    "Text": "The government move has come after seeing patients and relatives struggling in long queues for oxygen.\n\nDelhi residents living under home isolation due to COVID-19 needn't worry about availability of oxygen anymore. The state government has set up a new system to ensure the smooth availability of cylinders and the various district authorities have been made responsible for this.\n\nThose needing oxygen themselves or looking out for their relatives must register on the portal https://delhi.gov.in, a government release said today. They must submit, along with the application, copies of their Aadhar, Covid test report, and CT-Scan report if any.\n\n\"Each district has been assigned on re-filler for accessing its lump-sum allocation and the respective district magistrates have been directed to supervise the management of distribution of cylinders...\" the release said.\n\nThe government's move has come after witnessing residents struggling in long queues at various refill centres and depots across the city.\n\nAll district magistrates have been told to set aside enough a number of officials to sort the applications and ensure that those eligible receive their e-pass on priority.\n\nThose whose applications are approved will receive the e-pass from the district magistrate stating when, where, at what time, and at which depot they would get the oxygen cylinders, the release said. This will, however, depend on the availability of stocks.\n\nThe district magistrates have also been asked to appoint only such depots and dealers where availability is hassle-free so that the patients or their relatives are put into any further trouble for the sake of oxygen.\n\nThe facility of online bookings will be made available to Delhi residents from May 6.\n\nDelhi reported almost 21,000 fresh COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours along with 311 deaths. The city's overall case load now stands at 12.5 lakh, with over 18,000 deaths.\n\nAll this has put immense pressure on the city medical resources, with several patients reportedly dying due to a lack of oxygen in recent weeks.",

While some rich nations that secured effective vaccines early have seen their epidemics wane, the virus is still spreading like wildfire in developing economies, prolonging the pandemic.\n\nSuper Mutant Debunked\n\nMutations occur when the virus replicates, and India's unprecedented surge is driving new cases to global records, even as richer economies like the U.S. and Israel re-open quickly. Fearing an influx of infections and mindful of B.1.617, Singapore, the U.K. and Tanzania are among countries that have curbed travel to and from India.\n\nAustralia has banned its citizens from returning from India and imposed penalties of roughly $50,000 and five years imprisonment for violators.\n\nThe India strain has been called a double mutant because of the presence of two changes in the virus's genome, called E484Q and L452R. Both affect a portion of the spike protein, called the receptor binding domain, that's key to the virus entering cells.\n\nSome researchers estimate that the B.1.617 variant is as transmissible as the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the U.K., thought to be as much as 70% more transmissible than earlier versions of the virus.\n\nYet initial analyses indicate that the India version, now classified a variant of interest by the World Health Organization, poses a limited threat and doesn't appear to be more dangerous.\n\nCovaxin, the inactivated-virus vaccine being made by India's Bharat Biotech International Ltd., and AstraZeneca Plc's vaccine, called Covishield in India, are effective against the strain in preventing serious illness, said Rakesh Mishra, director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, one of the labs analyzing virus samples. Data is still being gathered about the response to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, Mishra said, but it's likely to be effective.\n\nBioNTech SE Chief Executive Officer Ugur Sahin said he was confident the mRNA shot it's making with partner Pfizer Inc. would work against the India mutant though testing is still ongoing. \"The Indian variant has the same mutation that we've already investigated and against which our vaccine was also effective,\" he said last week.\n\nSingapore, which tightened social distancing restrictions this week after findings cases linked to the India variant, has also seen vaccines hold up well to prevent serious illness, said Kenneth Mak, director of medical services in city-state's health ministry. But \"vaccination does not prevent you from getting infected 100%,\" he said in a Tuesday briefing.\n\nRavindra Gupta's team at the University of Cambridge recently studied the two mutations that appear on the receptor binding domain of the India variant's spike protein. The team tested viruses made to simulate the variant against serum from nine people who had already received a single dose of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine.\n\n\"We wanted to know whether this double mutant really is a double whammy,\" said Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge's Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases. What they found was that while each of the mutations could partly evade neutralizing antibodies, the two mutations didn't combine to create an even greater ability to evade immune protection.\n\n\"They don't combine to make a super mutant,\" Gupta said. \"It kind of debunks this view that this double mutant is doubly evading neutralizing antibodies.\"\n\nHere is the REALLY IMPORTANT part. The combination of the two mutations gives a value of 4, in other words the two mutations DO NOT confer substantial antibody evasion and we can stop using the term 'Double Mutant'. \u2014 Gupta Lab, Cambridge (@GuptaR_lab) May 1, 2021\n\nWhile the findings ease concerns around B.1.617, researchers are turning to the next set of variants as India's outbreak continues to rage. Genomic surveillance can provide crucial information on the new forms of this shape-shifting virus -- critical in preventing subsequent waves and developing the next generation of vaccines.\n\nIn the U.S., recent studies published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that a variant that caused concern when it emerged in New York isn't more dangerous than earlier strains, while a pair of mutants that surfaced in southern California \"might more frequently cause discernible and severe illness than do nationally circulating lineages overall.\"\n\nThe WHO has been monitoring variants through a global working group of laboratories, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the agency's technical lead officer. Information about new variants is coming in \"fast and furious,\" she said.\n\nBut as its health system is stretched to breaking point and Prime Minister Narendra Modi resists calls for a lockdown, the country's labs are ill-equipped to keep up with the necessary monitoring. Genomic sequencing that can identify new strains and track their progress is still relatively sparse in India, where only about 11,000 viruses have been analyzed, according to Mishra.\n\nWhile countries like the U.K. monitor about 5% to 10% of cases, in India far fewer are sequenced. To do so would require analyzing tens of thousands of samples daily, and failing to leaves a huge blind spot, according to Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health in Rhode Island.\n\n\"What genomic surveillance does,\" he said, \"is it helps you really track where infections are going and how things are spreading in a way India was pretty blind to.\"\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

    "Text": "This is Sanjay Jaiswal's second post within a week and Nitish Kumar's party is seething.\n\nTwo days after Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar declared a 10-day lockdown over Covid, but a leader of his ally BJP has put out an \"I-Told-You-So\" post on Facebook.\n\nIn the post that has enraged Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal United, Bihar BJP Chief Sanjay Jaiswal implies that the Bihar government ignored his advice to impose a lockdown when Covid cases in the state were less than 40,000. With over one lakh active cases now, he writes, there is no other option.\n\n\"Bihar government has imposed 11 days lockdown from today. Please follow this and save your and your family's life,\" says Mr Jaiswal's Facebook post.\n\n\"Governments have to take some difficult decisions for the interest of the citizens. Even today, there is lockdown in different states of half the countries of the world. In the meeting of Governor, when I talked about the 62-hour lockdown from Friday evening to Monday morning, the cases in Bihar were less than 40,000 but today due to more than one lakh active cases, Bihar government there is no other option for public welfare. All the representatives of the Bharatiya Janata Party are requested to stay in their area and worry about hospitals. Wake the public up to mask and 2 yards distance. I hope even the leaders who make political rhetoric by taking my name understand the ground reality,\" the Lok Sabha MP writes in the long post.\n\nThis is his second post within a week and Nitish Kumar's party is seething. Janata Dal United leaders point out that the BJP has the health portfolio in the coalition government and allege Mr Jaiswal's posts are meant to divert attention from the failure of the party's minister.\n\n\"Mr Jaiswal should come clean on how many ventilators he organised or whether he intervened to ensure oxygen allotments and other health needs for Bihar on the preferential basis from the central government,\" a JDU leader said.\n\nNitish Kumar announced on Tuesday that Bihar would go into lockdown till May 15. The announcement hours after the Patna High Court ordered the government to declare a lockdown, warning that otherwise, the court may step in.\n\nYesterday, the Chief Minister urged people to postpone weddings and other social functions, with the state reporting over 10,000 daily cases for several days.\n\nIn a previous Facebook post on May 1, Mr Jaiswal, who is a doctor, had made an alarming reference to a \"close friend in Patna who is a doctor and not picking up calls\" because he was helpless in a growing health crisis.\n\n\"The situation reached at the stage that even my close friend in Patna who is a doctor is not picking up my calls as he is unable to help. I have lost many known persons in the second wave,\" the BJP leader said in the Facebook post in Hindi.\n\nHis repeated posts have not helped ease the strained ties between Nitish Kumar and the BJP in their second straight term in power. The dynamics shifted this time round with Mr Kumar's party ending up with fewer seats and becoming the junior partner in the coalition.\n\nIndia today reported another global record of 4.12 lakh cases and 3,980 deaths in a day.",

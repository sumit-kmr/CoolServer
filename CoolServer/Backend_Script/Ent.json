    "Text": "Dancer Methil Devika was down with COVID-19 while working on production on \u2018solitude\u2019\n\nLife imitates art. Methil Devika found that out recently, the hard way.\n\nThe accomplished Mohiniyattam dancer had come down with COVID-19 and was hospitalised for a few days. And this happened at a time when she was working on an international project titled \u2018Ahalya\u2019 on the theme of \u2018solitude\u2019 imposed by the pandemic.\n\nDevika is one of the four Indian dancers commissioned by the Canada-based Sampradaya to make productions on the theme. Rama Vaidyanathan (Bharatanatyam), Aditi Mangaldas (Kathak) and Bijayini Satpathy (Odissi) are the others.\n\nDevika showed all the classical symptoms of COVID-19 while she was on working on the music of her production. Besides writing the script, in collaboration with Valmiki, she would tell you, smiling, she has also composed the music.\n\n\u201cI was suffering from breathlessness, but the deadline to finish my film was fast approaching. So I sang the track in that condition and mailed it to my musicians,\u201d says Devika. \u201cIt was indeed a severe form of COVID-19 that struck me.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, she had to isolate herself in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol. That experience came in handy when she enacted the role of Ahalya during the shoot of her production.\n\n\u201cI chose the tale of Ahalya for my film because I thought we all could relate, during these tough times, to her isolation and loneliness as she waited for Rama to end her curse,\u201d says Devika. \u201cI interpreted her character from my own perspective rather than those of other poets like Ezhuthachan. After reading different versions of The Ramayana, I went back to the original work by Valmiki.\u201d\n\nThe production, which she has choreographed and performed, is in the Mohiniyattam style, of course. She roped in ace cinematographer Madhu Ambat to shoot the film.\n\nAhalya premieres on shaale.com on May 9.",

    "Text": "Kawasaki Versys\u2019 engine is its crowning jewel, to say nothing of its impressive handling and comfortable seating\n\nEvery time I step off an adventure tourer, I am left with a sense of conviction about their aptness for our roads. They have the ability to gobble serious miles without compromising on comfort and also have a touch of sportiness sewn in. And that is where motorcycles like the Kawasaki Versys 1000 appear to make a strong case for themselves.\n\nThe Design\n\nFirstly, it is the sheer size of the Kawasaki Versys 1000 that captures your attention, leaving you a little intimidated as well. With its new ZX-6R inspired face, the Versys 1000 is a little easier on the eyes, but it is still not what you would call pretty.\n\nStep to the side and it becomes even more apparent that this motorcycle is built to chew miles all day long. The 21-litre tank, massive fairing and spacious seating are all indicative of the Versys\u2019 touring orientation. But there is no getting away from the fact that the bodywork is so huge that the relatively small 17-inch wheels make the motorcycle appear disproportionate, despite running sport-bike tyre sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other advantage of so much real estate is what is possibly the roomiest and comfiest rider and pillion seat in the class. The ergonomics are pretty relaxed, with a slightly pared-back footrest and an easy reach to the bar. That, along with the windscreen, takes the fatigue out of spending a whole day in the saddle.\n\nEngine & Performance\n\nThe Versys\u2019 engine is the crowning jewel of the whole package; it is the same engine that also powers the Ninja 1000SX, however, it makes less power and torque in the Versys. Nevertheless, 120hp and 102Nm are decent figures.\n\nWhen you fire up the engine, the sweet hum at idle feels like the calm before the storm. Once on the move, the loud intake howl is accompanied by a surge in acceleration that belies this motorcycle\u2019s size and weight. You get to unmentionable speeds in no time and the engine doesn\u2019t feel strained at any point. Slot the slick gearbox in sixth, and the Versys transforms into an effortless cruiser with enough juice in reserve to pull a quick overtake, sometimes even without down-shifting. Even in the city, the engine\u2019s tractability and heat management is impressive, making it capable of dealing with a city commute, if necessary.\n\nThe 2019 update to the Versys 1000 also brought in IMU assisted, three-step traction control (TC) and lean-sensitive ABS. Adding another layer of safety are the two power modes \u2014 Full and Low. The \u2018Low\u2019 mode chops power down to 75% and also softens the power delivery. This makes riding this big Kawasaki quite easy, whether in the wet or dry. However, we did find the TC to be too intrusive in some situations and it cuts power rather abruptly. A smoother throttle action does help to an extent, but Kawasaki needs to refine the system further so that it doesn\u2019t upset the chassis the way it currently does on loose and slippery surfaces.\n\nHandling\n\nIt is not just the performance but also the way this 255kg motorcycle handles that impresses. Get past the initial trepidation of riding a tall motorcycle and you will be surprised to see how well this motorcycle takes to the bends. There is oodles of grip and feedback through the chassis while the 17-inch wheels make life easy during quick direction changes.\n\nThe suspension does a pretty good job of absorbing undulations, and the ride quality over bad roads is comfortable enough despite the firm edge. Adjustability, however, is limited and one can tune the 43mm fork and monoshock for preload and rebound only.\n\nFor those wondering if they should wander off-road on this Versys, the motorcycle can only handle a mild trail. Because, the 17-inch wheels, fat tyres and 150mm of ground clearance aren\u2019t encouraging specifications to venture off the beaten path. The 310mm discs do a good job of hauling down the motorcycle to a stop while the ABS is well-calibrated to prevent unnecessary intervention.\n\nVerdict\n\nAt \u20b911.44 lakh, the Kawasaki Versys 1000 is nothing but a steal for the kind of performance it offers. Not to mention the sweet sound and character of an inline-four engine. In fact, at this price point, its biggest competition comes from its sibling the Ninja 1000SX. It may not have the ergonomics, suspension travel and all-day comfort of the Versys 1000 but it is more powerful and better equipped. That said, the Versys offers unbeatable value for someone looking for a supremely comfortable and fast road-biased touring motorcycle.",

    "Text": "Yasmin Zaidi\u2019s new artworks reflect on the COVID pandemic, isolation and grief\n\nYasmin Zaidi has begun to paint grief. It comes through in her two new works: one shows a young woman holding chrysanthemums in her arms, with graves behind; another has masked, socially distant people along a stairway (to heaven?).\n\nShe asked her family what to name them, and got a number of replies: Viral Apartheid 2021, Loveliness and Loneliness. \u201cI realised that everyone is feeling personally involved during this pandemic\u2026 They will give their own names to the paintings,\u201d says the 70-year-old artist who paints flowers and people.\n\nZaidi has lived across India \u2014 Firozpur Jhirka (in Haryana), JK Puram and JK Gram (in Rajasthan), Delhi and many more \u2014 where she worked as an educationalist through her life, mostly in administrative positions, though she trained as an English and Social Studies teacher. \u201cI taught art sometimes because I was just able to,\u201d says the hobbyist, whose home, when growing up, was filled with letters and pictures. Her father, Syed Ali Jawad Zaidi, was an Urdu poet and scholar, and her grandfather dabbled in art.\n\nShe draws from the various elements of Nature she has encountered through life: The stairway in her current oil on canvas leads towards birch trees she retrieved from mental images of Kashmir. The red bottle brush and yellow tecoma in the \u2018girl with chrysanthemums\u2019 are from her ground floor flat in Mumbai, where she has a little garden. \u201cMy mother was very fond of gardening,\u201d she remembers.\n\nYasmin Zaidi | Photo Credit: Special arrangement\n\nThis time though, flowers have been used as a metaphor for the departed. Urdu poet Afzal Ahmed Syed\u2019s Hamein Bahut Sare Phool Chahiye, which seems to allude to war and talks about how we need a lot of flowers to cover our dead, played in her head as she painted.\n\n\u201cWhen I paint, personal things come in \u2014 a book by Annie (her daughter, a writer), but the whole world was becoming personal,\u201d she says of the shock waves that seemed to have affected everyone.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t thought of selling: \u201cI hardly think of the paintings as belonging to me.\u201d She adds she wouldn\u2019t know how to, and even if she did, it would go to COVID relief.\n\nRight now, she\u2019s recovering from a gall bladder surgery and is with her son in Pune. \u201cI want to paint more, but I have run out of canvas, and it\u2019s difficult to get it right now,\u201d she says.",

With stricter norms in place and an escalation in the number of cases, she will have to wait longer to see Bell Bottom and Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui make their way to the cinemas. While she does that, she continues to watch movies and shows like an avid cinema fan in her me-time. Talking about it, Vaani says, \u201cAs a child, I used to daydream a lot. I had a protective family, and I led a super sheltered life. My dad and I would watch films together. He loves movies. Sometimes you just love doing things without a reason. Watching films was one of them for him and me. There are so many lives, so many stories and moments that you can live through cinema. It\u2019s one thing that would feel real to me even when I was a kid. It\u2019s the greatest de-stressor even today. With every story I watch, I explore a life that I won\u2019t be able to live in this one lifetime.\u201dVaani may have spent only seven years in the business, but she has been an ardent follower of cinema and has grown up to acquire a taste for cinema that blends both her parents\u2019 individual choices. \u201cYou\u2019ll laugh, but my sister and I would watch The Bold and The Beautiful. It aired at 3 pm in those days. We\u2019d return from school just in time, finish lunch and watch the show with mom. It\u2019s ridiculous for kids to watch such things, but I have fond memories of watching it with my mother and sister. With papa, it was Hindi films, all the way from Seeta Aur Geeta and Guide to Chaalbaaz. We completely enjoyed Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi\u2019s films. Dharmendra is my dad\u2019s favourite hero. I hope that someday I can have my dad meet him. My cousins and I would watch Shah Rukh Khan \u2019s films - all of them. My mother exposed me to Hollywood films, too. The Bridges of Madison County is my favourite. It could be any genre or actor, I can watch a film if it has great content. My inspirations range from Meryl Streep to Sridevi and Madhuri ma\u2019am.\u201dAs an actress in the business, was she ever star-struck when she met some of her matinee idols? \u201cStrangely, I don\u2019t get carried away when I am in their presence,\u201d says Vaani, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t let it affect me in that way. I love to see them. I have not overtly been intimidated in their presence, but I can\u2019t walk up to someone like Shah Rukh Khan and start a conversation on my own. I am a little reserved in that sense. I can stare like a stalker from a distance and appreciate their work on screen. Now, when I am in this profession, I know what we all do is a job. So, I don\u2019t get star-struck.\u201d",

    "Text": "\"I think the image that I have in the industry is changing,\" shares Vivan Bhatena , recollecting the days when people just considered him to be good-looking and not good at acting. The actor who was crowned Mr India World in 2001, made his debut with the popular television show \u2018Kyunki... Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi\u2019. After being an eminent face on television for around 7-8 years, Vivan moved to films and has been a part of films like 'Chak De! India', 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi', 'Karthik Calling Karthik', ' Judwaa 2', 'Hate Story 4' among many others. Now, the actor is all set to make his web debut with the upcoming MX Player show \u2018Ramyug\u2019. In an exclusive chat with ETimes, he opened up on his journey, the struggles of switching medium, and how he manages to stay relevant in showbiz. Read on:With time, I\u2019ve actually got very levelheaded; I do things that motivate me and inspire me. I've been winning at a very slow pace. I believe that you need to evolve, when you're just going to stagnate. I am saying this because, I have constantly switched careers the moment I felt I was not growing enough. At the end of the day, it's all down to you. And you can't blame anyone for success or failure. It\u2019s important to be part of good projects; do good work and people will remember you. In the end, it's not about the quantity of work that you have, but the quality of work.I was modelling for about three-five years and had got bored of it. It was getting a little stale for me, moving up and down on ramps, changing clothes, were not inspiring me. It wasn't really stable enough for me; I wanted to do something which moved me more. Hence, I started doing theatre, and understanding acting and seeing what I could do on stage really made a lot of difference.I randomly jumped into television, because all my friends were working on some show or the other with Balaji Telefilms . I got \u2018Kyunki...Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi' which just skyrocketed; I found myself doing television for seven years. That gave me a great understanding of acting and let me have my own place in the universe. And then, it got a little stale for me again. So, I moved on. I was reaching almost the top of the ladder and the only name ahead of me was Ronit Roy . I quit and rejected a few offers as it was not taking me anywhere. And at that point in time, there was a sudden shift happening where a lot of people who had worked on television shifted to films and left us with the rejects of small town actors who were very disrespectful and didn't speak very well. I just kind of felt that this is not a place for me anymore.I also lost a lot of work in television. There were many fights that I've gone into for getting the right screen space in television; there were people who were badmouthing me. I couldn\u2019t get work, and eventually, lost a lot of work. But I made sure that it didn\u2019t dampen me. I moved on to films, but yes, I had a very tough time because nobody was willing to give me a part in anything. And for five years, I had to sit at home and do nothing, It was very, very difficult.I lived with my savings. At that time, I had bought a new apartment. It was crazy and the hardest time of my life. But persevered through that and I had my wife\u2019s support. She told me to just stick to it and asked me to hold on. I picked up odd jobs like anchoring just to pay bills and keep moving ahead. Eventually, my patience led me to venture into films. I got some really good projects.People have had massive success in their 40s. So, I'm now hanging in there. Let's see what happens. I\u2019ve already started writing scripts, I\u2019ve been pitching for movies and slowly moving towards direction too. I\u2019ve recently directed an ad film. For me, it's a constant movement, constant evolution. And that's what, life is, for me. I like to live one day at a time. I don\u2019t plan much which keeps me motivated. I like to challenge myself to something new and with things which I have to focus on at the moment.I think the image that I have in the industry is changing. People know that I can act. Young people and younger generation are coming up to me and saying, \u2018You\u2019re one of those guys who's good looking and can act\u2019. I don\u2019t know how to respond to that, but I am glad people are actually acknowledging my work (laughs). I am being recognised and that's good. There\u2019s a change and shift that's coming. There's a lot of work that's being done. And OTT is giving people a lot of work. So yes, I\u2019m very happy.But yeah, I find a lot of people complaining of negativity towards Bollywood. But honestly, it's not that bad. I don't know why people make it out to be like this whole hornet's nest, calling out people as evil. Eventually, if you're good at your job, nobody can hold you down.You may lose a little bit of work here, a little bit of work there but eventually, they're going to get bored.\u2018Sooryavanshi\u2019, which I am hope gets a theatrical release. It\u2019s one of those movies which is meant for the halls. I also have a Telugu film and a few more exciting things to look forward to.",

He and his wife Kumudha had tested positive for the virus recently and were admitted to a private hospital. His condition deteriorated on Thursday morning and he breathed his last at the hospital. He was 74.\n\nPandu is a household name among Tamil movie fans. He joined the film industry following in the footsteps of his brother, Idichapuli Selvaraj, who was also a well-known comedian in the industry. Before joining show business, he was pursuing his interest in painting. It is noteworthy that he played a vital role in designing the flag of the AIADMK party, which was founded by matinee icon MG Ramachandran.\n\nPandu made his screen debut in the 1970s. And he went onto work with leading stars and directors spanning three generations. He has shared screen space with titans like MGR and Sivaji Ganesan and went on to work with Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth. He has also worked with Vijay and Ajith. One of his noted roles was in the romantic drama, Kadhal Kottai. He played the sidekick to Ajith\u2019s character in the film, which was released in 1996. The film was a huge box office hit and became a pop culture sensation at the time, establishing him as an actor.\n\nPandu\u2019s other memorable role was in Vijay\u2019s blockbuster film, Ghilli.

    "Text": "\u201cThe audience is very smart and will not accept everything that is dished out to them. However extravagant the product may be, they want to relate to it before accepting it wholeheartedly. Even if it is a remake, they want it to be at par or above the original, which rarely happens. Many times, it is done when the makers are fascinated or like a particular film and think they can make it better than the first one.\u201d\n\nActor-director Satish Kaushik\u2019s words ring true whenever a remake of a classic is on the anvil. That happened when Ramyug, which streams on MX Player starting today, was announced. Filmmaker Kunal Kohli wanted to \u201cbreathe life\u201d into the story of Lord Rama for \u201cyounger audiences on an unparalleled scale.\u201d\n\nMuch before the release of the magnum opus, the makers created hype by releasing its song \u201cJai Hanuman\u201d in the voice of Amitabh Bachchan, with Ustad Zakir Hussain at the tabla. The actors of the 1986 original \u2013 Arun Govil, Dipika Chikhlia and Sunil Lahri \u2013 amplified the series.\n\nOver the years, we have watched multiple versions of Ramyana \u2014 from Ramanand Sagar\u2019s TV show to Siya Ke Ram on Star Plus (2013) and Gurmeet Chaudhary-Debina Bonnerjee starrer on NDTV Imagine. Kunal Kohli\u2019s modernised version gets its target audience right as it is youth-oriented in its approach, but that is served along with awful CGI, ghastly acting and cringeworthy modification of the original.\n\nFrom a web series that is mounted on such a large scale with probably a lot of money spent on the visual effects, the least you\u2019d expect is that it would look picturesque. But, what you get instead is a lot of greenscreen work, which doesn\u2019t blend with the human drama. Even the action sequences look clumsy.\n\nThe storytelling of Ramyug is disappointing as it proceeds in a non-linear manner. Lord Rama, Sita and Lakshman are in the jungle but it takes until the third episode to understand the \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 behind it. In one of the scenes, when we meet Ravana for the first time, we see his ten heads circling and talking to him. Instead of adding to the impact of the scene and the persona of this crucial character, Ravana\u2019s introduction seems comic.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Akkshay A Dogra (@iakshaydogra)\n\nBut that\u2019s the challenge with replicating an epic, the comparisons are inevitable and sometimes unfair. If you are tuning to Ramyug just after watching the rerun of Ramanand Sagar\u2019s original on Doordarshan, chances are you will miss the warmth, divinity and calmness of Ram brought to the character by Arun Govil. Here, Ram, played by Diganth Manchale, is not a divine figure. Rather, he has a chiselled physique who belongs to this era. Even Sita is not the serene figure that Dipika Chikhlia brought to life. But I wish actor Aishwarya Ojha would have taken a lesson or two on acting from her counterpart. Kabir Singh Dohan also fails to create that sinister aura of Ravana. It is only Vivaan Bhatena (Hanuman) and Akshay Dogra (Lakshman) who do justice to their roles.\n\nIn my opinion, if you are in a mood to indulge in some nostalgia or want your kids to revel in the mythological drama, choose between the 1986 Ramayan and Siya Ke Ram (2013). Hoping Ramyug gets on track in the remaining five episodes.",

We encourage an investigation and hope that it gets returned to the rightful owners.\u201d\n\nArt dealer and interior designer Axel Vervoordt, named in the court papers, has worked with Kardashian and West on many of their properties, as per CNN.\n\nReferred to as \u2018Fragment of Myron Samian Athena\u2019, the statue is said to be from the early-to mid-Roman Empire. The report states that it was seized in May 2016 \u201cas part of a larger 5.5-ton (5,000 kg) shipment worth $745,000.\u201d The suspicion under which it was seized was \u201cprotected cultural property from Italy.\u201d",

    "Text": "Singer Iulia Vantur says Salman Khan and Disha Patani\u2019s performance on \u201cSeeti Maar\u201d in Radhe: My Most Wanted Bhai is amazing. Iulia, who has voiced the song along with Kamaal Khan, however, says making a new version of an existing chartbuster was a challenge.\n\n\u201cSeeti Maar\u201d has been recreated from the song by the same name from Telugu film, DJ: Duvvada Jagannadham, starring Allu Arjun and Pooja Hegde. In an interview with indianexpress.com, Iulia spoke about how she came on board Radhe and why the mixed response to the \u201cSeeti Maar\u201d song is normal.\n\n\u201cOf course, the song has been a huge hit in the south, so the challenge was even bigger to bring something new. Kamaal Khan has changed his voice completely for the song. There\u2019s the risk of audience not accepting the new version. But, the whole team has done an amazing job. They\u2019ve managed to give a version, as good (as the original),\u201d Iulia said in the exclusive interview.\n\nSpeaking about the critical reception that the song received, Iulia added, \u201cConsidering this song was made a huge hit by Allu Arjun, so obviously people would get emotionally attached to it. Also, you can\u2019t satisfy everyone, the tastes are different. That\u2019s why music has so many genres.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s however a section of listeners that is swearing by \u201cSeeti Maar\u201d. So much so, that it is nearing 92 million views on YouTube.\n\nHow much credit would Iulia give to the lead pair of Radhe, for the success of the song? \u201cSalman and Disha\u2019s moves are amazing. People love Salman\u2019s songs, his hook steps. They are very catchy, popular and easy to follow, that\u2019s the beauty. And he always comes up with something totally unexpected, interesting and funny. You just have to follow it. Of course, everyone including the music composer, choreographer, actors and dancers has put their efforts,\u201d the singer said.\n\nIulia also revealed that it was her test recording of the song for music composers Sajid-Wajid, which got incorporated in the final version. \u201cSajid used to give me different songs to practice and to test my voice. Later he called me and said he\u2019s sent my recording to composer Devi Sri Prasad, who has liked my voice and will keep it in the movie. Honestly, when I recorded the song, I thought it will be a test practice. And I\u2019ll get more time to practice. It was super unexpected for me,\u201d she said.\n\nIulia, however, laughed off when asked how she reacts when some people say that Salman Khan still promotes her in Bollywood. \u201cI feel blessed that I sing in Bollywood. The fact that I have someone to advice me from the music industry and Bollywood, again, is a big blessing. But, sometimes, you have to put much more to prove that you worked being in that place. Everyone\u2019s journey comes with plus and minus.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are songs where you feel the pressure of singing it right. There are many songs that I recorded, which aren\u2019t out yet. There are songs which didn\u2019t suit my voice, my style. Not all the songs see the light,\u201d she added.\n\nIulia has also crooned \u201cZoom Zoom\u201d in Radhe, which is yet to release. \u201cThat\u2019s again a very good song. I loved it. It\u2019s more teasing, playful and romantic. I feel it\u2019s catchy,\u201d Iulia revealed.\n\nRadhe, also starring Randeep Hooda and Jackie Shroff, is set to have a simultaneous release on theatre and ZEE5\u2019s pay per view platform ZeePlex on May 13, coinciding with Eid.",

    "Text": "Oscars producer Steven Soderbergh does not regret his decision to switch the awards order at the ceremony, a decision that has attracted a lot of criticism. The ceremony usually ends with the announcement of best picture winner but this year, it ended with best actor winner announcement, which went to Anthony Hopkins.\n\nWith the 83-year-old actor not in attendance and the producers not allowing Zoom acceptance speeches, many felt that the switch did not come off well for the pandemic era Oscars.\n\nSoderbergh, however, is not too concerned. \u201cSo the goal was to really do something different and let the academy sift through the response and decide what they would do going forward,\u201d Soderbergh told the Los Angeles Times in an interview.\n\nThe director had not allowed zoom acceptance speeches into the ceremony, which ended on a down note with the best actor winner Anthony Hopkins not there to accept his trophy in person.\n\nHopkins win for The Father had come as a surprise to many as fans were expecting a posthumous win for late Chadwick Boseman for Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom. When asked by the Times that, in hindsight, he would rethink the decision to prohibit attendance via Zoom. Soderbergh said, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe director, however, said the decision to not end the show with the standard best picture award was out of a respectful conscience.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thought it might be fun to mix it up, especially if people didn\u2019t know that was coming,\u201d Soderbergh said.\n\n\u201cSo that was always part of the plan. And then when the nominations came out and there was even the possibility that Chadwick could win posthumously, our feeling was if he were to win and his widow were to speak on his behalf, there would be nowhere to go after that. So we stuck with it.\u201d",

    "Text": "Do Kaliyaan released in 1968, when Neetu Kapoor was 10-year-old. (Photo: Neetu Kapooor/Instagram)\n\nVeteran actor Neetu Kapoor was already a successful child artiste before she made her debut as a leading actor in Rickshawala (1973). Many might remember her younger self for her innocent roles and mischievous smile. But, Kapoor has a different way of looking back at her work as a child actor.\n\nIn an Instagram post, she shared a clip from the song \u201cMurga Murgi Pyar Se Dekhe\u201d from her hit film Do Kaliyaan (1968). Neetu took note of the amount of make-up she had to use back then, even at the age of 10. \u201c#dokaliyan thopoed a lot of make up though,\u201d wrote Neetu along with the video, sung by Lata Mangeshkar.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by neetu Kapoor. Fightingfyt (@neetu54)\n\nDo Kaliyaan is a remake of Tamil movie Kuzhandaiyum Deivamum, which was an adaptation of The Parent Trap (1961). It also starred Biswajeet and Mala Sinha, and had Neetu in a double role of daughters Ganga and Jamuna.\n\nHer Instagram post received reactions from several B-town celebs. While daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni called her \u201ccutest\u201d, Saba Ali Khan Pataudi commented, \u201cMy favourite movie Neetu aunty. Do kaliyan\u2026. addict back then lol \u2026stay safe.\u201d\n\nSoni Razdan also wrote, \u201cOmg. You haven\u2019t changed a bit you know ! Cute then and now.\u201d Others who commented included Pakistani actor Mawra Hocane who believes her granddaughter Samara is a reflection of Neetu\u2019s expressions. She wrote, \u201cSo cute Neetu aunty!! Samara gives the same expressions now! Haha.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by neetu Kapoor. Fightingfyt (@neetu54)\n\nNeetu had last month too, taken a jibe at her song \u201cTere Chahne Wale Aaye Hain\u201d from Aatish (1979). Posting a clip, she wrote, \u201cI always wondered why I was made to look like a bird.\u201d\n\nHaving worked in over half a dozen films during childhood, Neetu was already a popular face before she did Rickshawala. Her work as child artiste includes movies like Suraj, Dus Lakh, Waris, Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani and Pavitra Paapi.\n\nNeetu made her Bollywood debut in the main lead at the age of 15 and went on to star with almost all the mainstream male actors of 1970s. Her onscreen pairing with Shashi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and late husband Rishi Kapoor were among the most successful ones.\n\nAlso read | Rishi Kapoor death anniversary: The Kapoor who kept on getting better with age\n\nNeetu, however, retired early at the age of 22 and tied the knot with Rishi Kapoor. She later made a comeback with Love Aaj Kal (2009). She went on to do Do Dooni Chaar, Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Besharam.\n\nHer upcoming film is Jug Jugg Jeeyo, alongside Anil Kapoor, Varun Dhawan and Kiara Davani.",

The series features the likes of Tisca Chopra, Dalip Tahil, Anup Soni and Vivan Bhaten in significant parts. Kohli had earlier shared his excitement about bringing such a beloved tale on screen once again.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe story of Rama has been retold by some of India\u2019s greatest writers both in Sanskrit and regional languages. I am honoured to have been able to breathe life into this narrative for younger audiences on an unparalleled scale with the help of in-depth writing, VFX, visually appealing direction, editing and post-production efforts.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Monster Hunter review: A mindless video game adaptation\n\nMonster Hunter: Book My Show stream\n\nDespite action stars like Tony Jaa and Milla Jovovich, Monster Hunter doesn\u2019t always live up to its potential, or even to the original source material (Monster Hunter is a video game adaptation).

The official synopsis of the movie reads, \u201c20-year-old law student Luisa, who comes from an upper-class family, joins Antifa because she is opposed to the rise of the political right in Germany. The plot is partly inspired by the biography of director Julia von Heinz, who belonged to Antifa herself when she was younger. The political design of the movie\u2019s right-wing Liste 14 party is also a reference to that of the Alternative for Germany.\u201d\n\nHai Taubba: ALTBalaji\n\nAnd if you have nothing better to do today, head over to ALTBalaji for an erotic drama titled Hai Taubba.

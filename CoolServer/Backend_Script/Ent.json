In this documentary, the director Loira Limbal captures life at Dee\u2019s Tots day care center in New Rochelle, N.Y. To do so involved filming around the clock: The center operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, under the watch of a couple, Deloris and Patrick Hogan, who runs the business out of their home. Limbal shows both the warmth and the extreme labor required to keep the business running. She also follows some of the parent clients, whose own demanding lives \u2014 working multiple jobs, taking on night shifts \u2014 led them to the center in the first place. The documentary \u201cbears witness to the struggles of these working people, to their tenderness and mercy,\u201d Teo Bugbee wrote in her review for The New York Times. Limbal, Bugbee added, \u201ckeeps her gaze steady, and her v\u00e9rit\u00e9 rigor becomes an act of solidarity.\u201d\n\nLIFETIME PRESENTS VARIETY\u2019S POWER OF WOMEN THE COMEDIANS 8 p.m. on Lifetime.

Her brother, actor Tom Arnold, also reflects on the project\n\n\u201cYou know, I was never scared,\u201d starts Lori Arnold, \u2018If anything, I felt empowered, respected, feared, and you feed into that kind of stuff. I was always a bad*ss, I like being a bad*ss. I liked running sh*t. I wanted people to look up to me, be scared of me. Selling came easy to me \u2013 I was the brains, and Floyd [my partner] was the muscle. But I would say that I\u2019m more addicted to the power. That fed my ego. I want people to look up to me, respect me.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here\n\nIf you do not know Lori Arnold, you may have gotten a little sense of \u2018is this woman a drug dealer?\u2019 Yes, Lori indeed was \u2013 in fact, she is known as \u2018the original Walter White.\u2019 Her journey from a young teenager being addicted to methamphetamines to her Midwest-wide drug empire as a grown woman is documented in a Discovery+ series aptly titled The Queen of Meth.\n\nMetroPlus got talking with Lori and her more well-known brother Tom Arnold (of Roseanne fame), about their return to Ottumwa, as they recall Lori\u2019s arc through the years. Was it hard to return to these \u2018old stomping grounds\u2019?\n\n\u201cOttumwa is my hometown and I love it. It\u2019s a quintessential middle American town. Not many changes there, which makes it special and comforting, but for someone like me with a past and triggers with addiction, it can make it somewhat difficult,\u201d admits Lori.\n\nThe true story\n\nIf you have run a methamphetamine empire in a quiet state, chances are you will be approached by dozens of filmmakers who want to tell your story. This was certainly the case with Lori over the years, but she turned down opportunities for years until it felt right.\n\nTom Arnold | Photo Credit: Discovery+\n\nTom commends series director Julian P Hobbs and says he connected with the filmmaker on many levels but especially in terms of family. \u201cThe thing that sold me the most was when his daughter came over to my house to go through some of my pictures, I saw their relationship and that told me, \u2018this guy gets family, and I think he knows where we were coming from,\u2019 but it\u2019s always a risk and I felt like it was worth taking it with him. He knows how to produce shows like this and show humanity, but also deal with crime and truth.\u201d\n\nLori states that whether or not America or the world liked her story was not a factor to her; the most prevalent element was the truth. She elaborates, \u201cI was very adamant about \u2018you better tell the truth or don\u2019t tell it at all.\u2019 I want it told the way it is. Julian was extremely professional about it. His whole team made me feel comfortable. I wasn\u2019t like Tom with hundreds of movies, I had never been on TV except in handcuffs and shackles, so it was different for me.\u201d\n\nTom, 62, adds that Lori\u2019s story has been in existence but in a private and unpublished book form. \u201cI told her, \u2018you need to just write a book about yourself.\u2019 Anytime you write, there\u2019s something very spiritual about that. And I thought, with my sister being in prison for a long time, she could just get up and write something about her life. So she wrote a very thick book not to be published or anything and they do use some of that in this documentary series.\u201d\n\nThe global fascination with the true crime genre skyrocketed during the pandemic and Tom comments, \u201cPeople that like to watch crime shows, and they also like to watch \u2018reality-family.\u2019 The Queen of Meth has both and there\u2019s redemption too. And hopefully entertaining, and real.\u201d\n\nAs parents...\n\nNaturally, Tom was indeed nervous about how he and his sister would appear but is pleased with how the project turned out. He still feels protective of Lori, who is a year-and-a- half younger. How did working on The Queen of Meth further shape their relationship? \u201cThrough her childhood, drug business and marriages, she was very tough, but thinking back, I do remember her being vulnerable as a kid. I was afraid that, given all she\u2019s been through, that you couldn\u2019t penetrate her shell. And the director wanted me to do that, but I said, \u2018I\u2019m not here to do that.\u2019 But what ended up happening was because of her son who grew up with this (when he was 10, his parents went away to prison and we got to raise him), her son got to confront his mother in ways that just would not have happened.\u201d\n\nAn old photograph of Lori Arnold and son Josh Stockdall in 1981. | Photo Credit: Lori Arnold\n\nLori says the hardest part was anything to do with her son but she is proud of the man he is now. \u201cHe was only 10 at the time Floyd and I were arrested, and he lost his home and parents all at once.\u201d\n\nTom, a father himself, says, \u201cThere are a lot of ghosts in Ottumwa, but I was happy with the way it turned out that I\u2019m a father with an eight-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter. And I don\u2019t want them to have anything close to the life that Lori and I had. Just seeing and remembering how things were and being honest about it, it only helped me to be sober, healthy and a better parent. And that\u2019s what life\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, what does Lori hope for herself? She concludes, \u201cThe \u2018Queen of Meth\u2019 title is not something to be proud of, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ll never get away from. I got out of prison, but I'm doing pretty much a life sentence for selling drugs.\u201d\n\nThe Queen of Meth drops on Discovery+ on May 7",

    "Text": "After winning the title of Miss India Earth in 2014, Alankrita Sahai decided to make a career in Bollywood and has come a long way since. She is bold, beautiful, talented, and determined to make it on her own. In an exclusive interview with ETimes, the gorgeous diva opened up about her initial days in showbiz, being an outsider in the industry , and people who have inspired her. Excerpts\u2026I look back at my journey with gratitude and hope that I keep progressing and becoming a better version of myself, both professionally and personally. I believe it was definitely a different path than what people had expected of me, but I found myself amidst the chaos in Mumbai and it was life-changing. I enjoyed both the successes and the failures.It wasn\u2019t easy at all. People perceive women in this industry in a very different light. I don\u2019t understand why and who created these misconceptions. People had various things to say and do to stop me from growing but my family and my friends stood by me. It is a general perception that models are dumb or can\u2019t act or perform, but we are much more than just models and actors, we are humans.I was trained in dancing and acting since I was a kid, thanks to my school and university. However, to explore the camera was a different ball game altogether. So, I enjoyed learning the tricks of the trade. After pageants, people expect a lot from you; they think you will become an overnight success, which doesn\u2019t happen. You have got to work on it. Priyanka Chopra has inspired me. I don\u2019t even need to say how and why she is the epitome of strength, perseverance, and ambition. Even Dia Mirza is great for all the work she does to save our planet and how simple and beautiful she\u2019s been throughout her journey. It is just so easy to relate with her.A lot has been said about the industry and while some things are true, others are false. But I have had a blast here. The good came with the bad. There has been favouritism but no one dared to cross the line because I make sure I look really arrogant and unapologetic for being me; I have never succumbed to the bullies nor tried to impress people for work.I am very honest with my work because I like to sleep peacefully at night knowing that I did this on my own, for myself and by myself. I have had a wonderful team always backing me and protecting me. So, I have been fortunate. Bollywood gave me an identity of my own, financial abundance, and independence and I am still trying to make it big here. The journey never ends.",

    "Text": "Nayattu movie cast: Kunchako Boban, Joju George, Nimisha Sajayan\n\nNayattu movie director: Martin Prakkat\n\nNayattu movie ratings: 3.5 star\n\nNayattu, which means the hunt, is a sad reflection of the times we live in. We are part of the period in human history where truth seems to have little or no value. In the post-truth era, we don\u2019t want facts. We don\u2019t want a thorough investigation into a case to get to the bottom of it; all we want is a good show. We want a show of justice without procedural fairness. Who gets justice (however shallow or imaginary it might be) and who gets sent to jail depends on the political agenda of the time.\n\nSo, it is election season in Kerala. The people in the government are busy chalking their winning strategies and fully focused on consolidating their vote base, while the governance of the state takes a back seat. It is that time of the year, where even low-ranking cadres in a political party get to make their demands. \u201cSir, after the election, please get those troublesome police officers suspended,\u201d tells a party functionary to the chief minister. It is not a request. It is a polite order. And the all-powerful CM nods his head in affirmation while clenching his fist.\n\nKunchako Boban\u2019s CPO Praveen Michael gets posted to a new police station, where he becomes friends with ASI Maniyan (Joju George) and constable Sunitha (Nimisha Sajayan). The three stand by each other and in the process, they cross an egoistical youngster who belongs to a political outfit that has ties with the government in power. The man in question never seems to miss an opportunity to rub it in the faces of cops, given it makes him feel more powerful and gives meaning to his existence. The script is so dense that we could clearly see between the lines, what is causing such a massive power imbalance between a nobody and a bunch of cops, including high-ranking officers.\n\nFollowing an unfortunate incident, Praveen, Maniyan and Sunitha become prime suspects in a murder case. Spoiler alert: nobody murdered anybody. Due to an unfortunate road accident, one of the party workers of the government dies. Against his best judgment, Maniyan gives in to Praveen\u2019s request and decides to take the injured motorist to the hospital and save his life. And that jeopardizes all the plans of Praveen, Maniyan and Sunitha.\n\nPraveen may have overcome his heartbreak and married Sunitha. And Maniyan may have finally gone to his daughter\u2019s school event. But, even in their wildest dreams, they would have never imagined that they would become the subject of a witch hunt spearheaded by their colleagues. Maybe, if there had been a fair system that functioned on objective facts, Praveen, Maniyan and Sunitha may have continued to pursue the plans they had for themselves. But, in cases, where political masters dictate the outcomes of the investigation, facts and justice are the first casualties.\n\nNayattu is as much a thriller as it is the indictment of the failure of the public to be reasonable. As long as the circus is good, we never really care what\u2019s going behind the curtain. Writer Shahi Kabir\u2019s strong and direct observations resonate with us considering how the power brokers use the media to whip up anger against a target that benefits them politically. Director Martin Prakkat has done a terrific job in visually bringing out all the keen observations of Kabir and painting a bigger picture of the system, which is bent to keep the public in dark.",

    "Text": "Actor Neelima Azeem and daughter-in-law Mira Kapoor, wife of actor Shahid Kapoor, have often shared words of praise for each other. After calling her a friend in a previous interview, Neelima Azeem opened up on how Mira is another child for her who is \u201cextremely intelligent and well-informed.\u201d She credits her daughter-in-law for bringing the family together.\n\n\u201cMira has given me the tag of a cool mother in law. She has often called me so in several instances. It gives me a great sense of satisfaction. I feel happy about myself. What could be better that you have another child. Whether it is a son-in-law or daughter-in-law, suddenly you a child that you have not laboured for, brought up or this and that. It is like a gift,\u201d the actor told Bollywood Bubble in a recent interview.\n\nShe added, \u201cMira has brought us the biggest joys. She brought Misha and Zain into our lives. She brought the whole family together. Ever since Misha and Zain have been born, Mira has set up all the family gatherings. She always has interesting new stuff to contribute. I find her very creative. Now, of course, she has broken out into her own and doing very well. She is extremely intelligent and educated and well-informed. She is very calm and easy. No drama, tantrums or wanting to get attention. She glued our family together. She deserves the praise, she earned it. She is not a demanding brat. She has graced her lives. She loves her husband, brother-in-law and her kids. Our interests are also very personal.\u201d\n\nOn Mother\u2019s Day, Mira Kapoor posted a picture of herself with Neelima Azeem and wrote that her \u201cpositivity and zest for life is so inspiring.\u201d She also mentioned that she loves that they are always on the same side.\n\nDuring the interview, Azeem also spoke a bit about Shahid Kapoor and Ishaan Khatter and their growing up years. She said she carried both of them to her work when they were babies. Addressing her separation with Pankaj Kapur and how it affected Shahid, if at all, the actor revealed that Shahid was brought up under the care of her parents and her extended family.\n\nShe concluded talking about how Ishaan and Shahid are never a part of nepotism conversation, \u201cI never told my Guru that I had link with Nawab of Rampur. When years later he got to know, I told him that the reason was to built on my own. I have seen that in life when you work on yourself all alone, you polish yourself in a beautiful way. I have seen Ishaan spending most of his time growing, imbibing and learning on his own, which is wonderful because he is very individual because of that and his work reflects it.\u201d\n\nNeelima\u2019s interview came right after Shahid\u2019s Instagram post for her on Mother\u2019s Day in which he wrote that she is \u201calways the wind beneath our wings.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer gaze is loving and forgiving and always sees us as the best version of ourselves. She has nurtured us with so much love that we are capable of passing it on and spreading it into the world. Being the older one by almost 14 years my bond with mom has been very unique, like a friend. And our journey has been beyond words. There is no one who can be you mom,\u201d he wrote.",

(Photo: AP)\n\nWonder Woman actor Gal Gadot has said in a recent interview that Joss Whedon threatened her career while they were working together on the set of 2017\u2019s Justice League. This revelation comes in the wake of more than a year of reports talking about Whedon\u2019s less than ideal behaviour on the sets of the movie.\n\nIn an interview with Israel\u2019s N12 News, Gadot said, \u201cWhat I had with Joss basically is that he kind of threatened my career and said if I did something he would make my career miserable. I handled it on the spot.\u201d\n\nWhile there were various reports circulating that Whedon misbehaved with Gadot, but this was the first time the actor herself has confirmed it.\n\nOne report in The Hollywood Reporter had said that Gadot had concerns with the direction the movie and her character was taking. The report also said Whedon disparaged Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman\u2019s director.\n\nRay Fisher, who played the role of Victor Stone or Cyborg, was the first actor to open up about Whedon\u2019s alleged misconduct with cast members. On July last year, he tweeted, \u201cJoss Wheadon\u2019s on-set treatment of the cast and crew of Justice League was gross, abusive, unprofessional, and completely unacceptable. He was enabled, in many ways, by Geoff Johns and Jon Berg. Accountability>Entertainment.\u201d\n\nJohns and Berg were two of the producers on Justice League. Joss Whedon was also accused by various cast members of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In February this year, Charisma Carpenter, who played the role of Cordelia Chase, said Whedon has a \u201chistory of creating toxic and hostile work environments.\u201d\n\nFollowing Fisher\u2019s accusations, Warner Bros conducted an investigation and later said remedial action was taken. Though not disclosed, it is said that Whedon losing the HBO fantasy series The Nevers was part of it.\n\nWhedon was brought to Justice League by Warner Bros executives as they did not like the darker tone Zack Snyder\u2019s original cut had. When Snyder had to leave the project altogether due to a personal tragedy, Whedon was handed the reins and he went on to do extensive reshoots. The finished version that hit theatres in 2017 was said to be his cut of the movie. The film was panned by critics and was also a commercial disaster and also derailed the DCEU.",

The Global Citizen fundraising concert advocating the importance of vaccine equity has pulled in 302 million dollars, exceeding the goal for the organisation\u2019s campaign, AP reported.\n\nApart from Big B, the show, which was hosted by Selena Gomez, was attended by several thousand fully-vaccinated concertgoers who cheered on performances by Eddie Vedder, Foo Fighters, J Balvin, H.E.R. and Lopez, who enjoyed a duet with her mom. The concert was shot earlier this month but aired on Saturday evening.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan, who said he was \u201cprivileged to be a part of the concert and the fight for India\u201d, posted a video in which he urged global citizens to rise and help India in fighting the deadly second wave of Covid-19.\n\nT 3900 \u2013 Privileged to be a part of the concert .. and the fight for India .. pic.twitter.com/vlyhKVc6QG \u2014 Amitabh Bachchan (@SrBachchan) May 9, 2021\n\n\u201cNamaskar, this is Amitabh Bachchan. My country India is battling with the sudden surge of the second wave of Covid 19. As a global citizen I appeal to all global citizens to rise up, speak to your governments, pharmaceutical companies and ask them to donate, to give, to extend a helping hand, to the public that needs it the most. Every effort counts. As Mahatma Gandhiji said: \u2018In a gentle way you can shake the world\u2019. thank you,\u201d he said in the video.\n\nThe event also emphasised the importance of vaccination.\n\nOn Saturday, Big B wrote a long post on his blog in which he spoke about how celebrities are criticised for not publicising their contribution during the difficult times. He said that him and his family have hardly succumbed to the pressure of social media and the \u201cevery day abuse and the filth of distasteful comments\u201d and contributed or made their effort in the quiet. \u201cOnly the receiver knew and that was the end,\u201d wrote the actor. While the actor has not spoken about his contribution, it has come to light that he has contributed Rs 2 crore towards a Covid-19 facility in Delhi.\n\nIn the blog, he went on to divulge details on

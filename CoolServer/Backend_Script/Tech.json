Read More\n\nGoogle\u2019s bet on Chromebooks \u2014 relying heavily on the excellent ChromeOS \u2014 seems to have paid off handsomely. Sometime in 2019, Microsoft had spoken about Windows 10X, a lighter version of Windows which could take on ChromeOS. However, it looks like Microsoft may have dropped the idea of readying an answer to Chromebooks. A report by The Verge says that 2021 will not see the arrival of Windows 10X. Further, it says that Windows 10X may not ever come and Microsoft could include some features of Windows 10X into Windows 10.\n\nWindows 10X was being designed as a direct competitor to ChromeOS. It reportedly would\u2019ve had a new simple user interface, the Start menu would\u2019ve been different among other features. Microsoft\u2019s idea was to have a toned-down cloud-based version of Windows. However, it does look like the idea has been shelved.\n\nIt was no surprise to see Microsoft working on ChromeOS rival as Chromebooks really seem to have taken off in the last year. \u201cChromebooks are well and truly a mainstream computing product now,\u201d said Brian Lynch, Canalys Research Analyst. \u201cWhile the education sector still accounts for the majority of shipments, their popularity with consumers and traditional commercial customers has reached new heights over the course of the last year.\u201d\n\nChromebook shipments grew as much as by 275% in Q1 of 2021. Lynch of Canalys added in a press release that \u201cGoogle is now in a strong position to work with its OEM partners and the channel to cement a rosy future for Chromebooks. A substantial messaging and evangelisation push coupled with the targeting of growth trends, such as flexible work arrangements and budget-conscious SMBs, will be vital to ensure the longevity of Chromebooks\u2019 success.\u201d\n\n",

The company aims to bring its S Pen experience to other high-end smartphones and is focusing a lot on the new foldable Galaxy Z series smartphones.\n\nAccording to a new report by Yonhap News, Samsung is expected to hold a Galaxy Unpacked event in mid-August where the company is said to launch the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Flip 3 and the Galaxy S21 FE.\n\nEarlier rumour revealed that the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 would launch in July. But the new phones will allegedly be released in August along with the Galaxy S21 FE and will help in filling the gap which will be left by Galaxy Note.\n\nAnother online report by LetsGoDigital revealed that the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is expected to come with S Pen support. The report claims that Samsung filed for a trademark with European Union Intellectual Property Office last week. The trademark filed under Class 9 has \u201csmartphones, tablets, protective covers; electronic pen; capacitive stylus\u201d as its description.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is expected to be priced around $1,099 (Rs 80,770).\n\nMeanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will go into mass production in July and it is rumoured to launch in August this year. The smartphone is said to come in Gray, Light Green, Light Violet and White colour options.\n\nAs per leaks and rumours, the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE will follow similar design aesthetics as the Galaxy S21 series. Samsung Galaxy S21 FE is said to sport a 6.4-inch AMOLED display. The display is also expected to house a 32MP punch-hole selfie camera.\n\nThe smartphone is expected to be either powered by Exynos 2100 or Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor. The handset is said to be backed by a 4500mAh battery.\n\n",

He also demonstrates that how a non-hacked AirTag redirects to the Find My website, whereas the altered AirTag redirects to an unrelated URL that could lead to phishing, however, the extent of this is unclear at this time.For now, we will have to wait and see how the Cupertino-based tech giant is able to block this kind of modification.To recall, AirTag was launched last month at the company\u2019s first event of 2021, where it also launched new iPad and iMac models along with their accessories, a Purple colour variant of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini.In India, the AirTag costs Rs 3,190 for a single piece and can be bought in packs of four at Rs 10,900.",

    "Text": "Xiaomi\u2019s Redmi Note 10S is the next budget smartphone that the company will launch on May 13 in India. Ahead of the launch, the sale page has gone live on Amazon India along with all the key specifications of the phone. The Redmi Note 10S is supposed to be a gaming focused option in the series.\n\nAccording to the Amazon page, the Redmi Note 10S will have a 64MP quad-camera, an AMOLED display, and it will be powered by the Helio G95 processor from MediaTek. It also continues with the new Evol design seen in the other Redmi Note 10 phones, which have already launched in India.\n\nThe battery is 5000 mAh with support for 33W fast-charging. The Redmi Note 10S will also come with an IP53 rating, Corning Gorilla Glass on the front and back. It will also come with dual-stereo speakers and Hi-Res audio certified.\n\nThe Redmi Note 10S will join the other three phones in the lineup; which are the Redmi Note 10, Redmi Note 10 Pro and Pro Max. The Pro Max is the most expensive variant so far with a 108MP camera at the back. The Redmi Note 10 Pro also has a 64MP camera, but it runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G processor instead of the MediaTek one which will be seen on the Redmi Note 10S.\n\nRedmi Note 10S: Expected specifications, price\n\nThe Redmi Note 10S has a 6.43-inch FHD+(1,080\u00d72,400 pixels) display in the global variant and comes with up to 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. Other than the 64MP main camera, the rear camera includes an 8MP ultra-wide camera, 2MP macro camera and 2MP depth sensor. The front camera is 13MP.\n\nGiven the phone will focus on gaming, it remains to be seen how Xiaomi will price the smartphone. The Redmi Note 10 launched at Rs 11,999 for the 4GB RAM option, while the 6GB RAM variant costs Rs 13,999. However, the price has now increased to Rs 12,499 for the 4GB RAM variant and the 6GB RAM version costs Rs 14,499. The Redmi Note 10 Pro starts at Rs 15,999 while the Pro Max at Rs 18,999.\n\nGiven the specifications, the Redmi Note 10S will likely be priced between the Redmi Note 10 and Redmi Note 10 Pro, though Xiaomi could also go really aggressive and price it starting under Rs 12,000 as well.",

The move will allow Android users to experience the popular audio-based social network for the first time. However, the beta app is currently live in the US but the company says the Android app will come to other English-speaking markets and then the rest of the world.\n\nThe arrival of Clubhouse on Android, the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system, will only help increase the popularity of the app. Clubhouse began testing the Android app earlier this year. For those users outside of the US, they can pre-register their interest in the app via the Clubhouse page on the Play Store. Once the app is available in their country, the users will be notified.\n\n\u201cOur plan over the next few weeks is to collect feedback from the community, fix any issues we see and work to add a few final features like payments and club creation before rolling it out more broadly,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\n\nClubhouse has millions of users worldwide. (Image credit: Clubhouse) Clubhouse has millions of users worldwide. (Image credit: Clubhouse)\n\nThe invite-only app allows users to find and listen to conversations between groups of people. The buzziest social media app has millions of followers, including famous celebrities and tech honchos such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. The social audio app lets people gather in audio chat rooms to discuss various topics, whether it\u2019s sports, tech, motivation, etc. Rooms are usually divided into two groups: those who are talking and those who are listening.\n\nThanks to the surge in popularity of Clubhouse, there is an increase in interest in audio-based social apps. Twitter recently expanded access to Spaces this month. Facebook, meanwhile, is developing an audio-chat experience that could be added in the Messenger. Even Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn is working on a similar feature.\n\nClubhouse is currently valued at $4 billion. The app was launched last year by two tech veterans Paul Davison and Rohan Seth.",

In some markets such as China, invitations were so sought after some were auctioned on online marketplaces.\n\nBut downloads of the app, one measure of popularity, have significantly fallen.\n\nAfter peaking in February with 9.6 million downloads, that number fell to 2.7 million in March and then 900,000 downloads in April, according to Sensor Tower.\n\nThe drop has sparked questions about its long term viability and whether its success was owed in part to people spending more time at home during the pandemic.\n\nThe long anticipated Android launch is expected to reach more new users globally. The Android version will reach other English-speaking markets and then the rest of the globe days and weeks after the US market beta launch.\n\nClubhouse, which created the category, now faces the likes of Facebook, whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in April a slew of audio products, including Clubhouse-style live audio rooms and a way for users to find and play podcasts.\n\nIn January, Twitter said that it will introduce a new feature to let users charge admission to their live audio chat rooms in its Spaces feature, as the company seeks to court more content creators.

    "Text": "Billionaire Elon Musk dropped a surprise early in his hotly anticipated turn as host of Saturday Night Live, saying in his monologue that he \"is the first person with Asperger's\" to host the show, before clowning through skits for the first global livestream of the NBCUniversal comedy show.\n\nMusk, one of the world's richest individuals, opened his monologue by telling an audience in more than 100 countries he is \"the first person with Asperger's to host SNL. At least the first to admit it.\" The billionaire made light of his tendency to speak in a monotone, adding \"I'm pretty good at running human in emulation mode.\"\n\nAsperger syndrome is a condition on the autism spectrum that is associated with difficulty in social interaction, and sometimes is referred to as high functioning autism.\n\nComedian and Saturday Night Live alumni Dan Aykroyd has spoken in interviews about being diagnosed with a mild form of Asperger's. He hosted Saturday Night Live in 2003.\n\nMany had wondered how Musk would handle himself during a live comedy show. The answer was that he, and the show's writers, sought to soften the rough edges of Musk's public persona. Throughout the show, Musk gently poked fun at himself, including his penchant for provocative tweets and the time he smoked a joint on a podcast.\n\n\"To anyone I've offended I just want to say, I reinvented electric cars and I'm sending people to Mars on a rocket ship. Did you think I would be a chill, normal dude?\"\n\nMusk's mother, Maye, joined him on stage and the two made a joke about Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency Musk has touted. Cryptocurrency jokes popped up throughout the show. In one sketch, Musk was cast as a bow-tie wearing cryptocurrency expert on the show's Weekend Update segment. Dogecoin and other digital currencies had surged in price ahead of Musk's SNL appearance.\n\nDogecoin fell during the show and was last down about 12 percent from late Friday at around $0.53 (roughly Rs. 40). It hit a record high Thursday above $0.73 (roughly Rs. 50).\n\nMusk was most convincing playing a version of himself as head of SpaceX dealing with an emergency on a Martian colony. The crisis had a happy ending, until it didn't.\n\nIn the end, Musk will keep his day jobs. Still, the Saturday Night Live appearance offered plenty of synergies with his real gigs as \"technoking\" and Chief Executive of Tesla, head of rocket launch company SpaceX and even chief of the Boring Company, a tunnel construction venture.\n\nMusk got days of attention across all forms of media ahead of the show, and shared the spotlight with a prototype of Tesla's futuristic Cybertruck that Tesla brought to Manhattan on Friday. Video of the hulking, angular pickup prowling Manhattan streets blew up on social media.\n\nDuring the show, a Tesla supercharger made an incongruous cameo appearance in a skit set in an old West saloon. Musk played a gunslinger who had developed an electric horse, and advocated tunneling through the earth to escape a shootout.\n\nMusk often boasts that Tesla doesn't spend billions on advertising the way established automakers do. He doesn't have to so long as he has access to platforms like Twitter or Saturday Night Live.\n\nMusk's appearance also boosted NBCUniversal. The media company used Musk's global celebrity - and the controversy surrounding his appearance on a stage normally reserved for film stars or professional comedians - to get attention for launching the \"Saturday Night Live\" franchise beyond the confines of broadcast television. The company said Saturday's show was streamed live via Alphabey's YouTube to more than 100 countries.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021",

    "Text": "If Epic Games hopes to dismantle the fortress surrounding Apple's iPhone and its app store, the video game maker probably will need to roll out some heavier artillery heading into the second week of a trial threatening Apple's $2 trillion empire.\n\nSo far, at least, Epic has been having trouble proving its allegations that the iPhone maker's 13-year-old app store has turned into an illegal monopoly.\n\nEpic, the maker of the popular Fortnite game, contends Apple has been gouging app makers by charging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% for in-app transactions because it forbids other options on its iPhone, iPad and iPod. When Epic tried to evade the commissions with an alternative payment system in Fortnite last August, Apple ousted it from the app store to set up a legal showdown that could force it to lower its fees.\n\nApple contends the commissions are a reasonable toll paid by a minority of the 1.8 million apps in its store to help cover the more than $100 billion it has invested in mobile software, The Cupertino, California, company also maintains its ironclad control over apps allowed on its mobile devices helps protect its customers' security and privacy.\n\nAt times, it seemed like Cary, North Carolina-based Epic was helping make Apple's case as much as its own during the the first week of the trial being held in an Oakland, California, courtroom.\n\nFor instance, at one point during his two days on the witness stand, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney acknowledged he personally used an iPhone instead of smartphones running on Google's Android software because he thought Apple offered better security and privacy controls.\n\nSweeney also acknowledged Apple made changes to iPhone's software to help make it possible for Fortnite players to compete against each other while one was on a phone and the other was on a video game console. The expansion of so-called \u201ccross-platform\" play helped propel Fortnite's growth to more than 400 million users.\n\nOther internal documents showed Epic's executives profusely thanking Apple for the support Fortnite was getting in the app store.\n\nOther evidence raised questions about whether Epic's efforts to create a competing app store that imposes a commission of only 12% will pay off. The store is expected to post a profit ranging from $15 million to $36 million by 2024, but it will still have run up cumulative losses $654 million to $854 million, according to Epic's internal projections presented at the trial.\n\nApple's store, by contrast, quickly became highly profitable shortly after it opened with just 500 apps in 2008 \u2014 a year after the debut of the first iPhone. Epic has repeatedly pointed to evidence that Apple's late co-founder Steve Jobs initially didn't expect the app store to be a profit center, but then apparently changed his mind after it accumulated $2.1 billion in billings during 2010, according to an Apple slide presentation.\n\nThe trial hasn't yet revealed just how profitable Apple's app store has become. Apple doesn't disclose the store's financial results, but it is an important part of the company's steadily growing services division, which generated $57 billion in revenue last year alone. The success of those services coupled with the iPhone's ongoing popularity is a key reason why Apple currently boasts a market value of $2.2 trillion \u2014 more than any other U.S. company. In contrast, privately held Epic is valued at nearly $30 billion.\n\nMore financial details about Apple's app store are expected to be presented during the trial's second week. Perhaps the most revealing moments may come when one of Epic's experts, Ned Barnes of the Berkeley Research Group, takes the stand to discuss his analysis of the app store's profits.\n\nApple unsuccessfully tried to convince U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to close the courtroom during Barnes' testimony because his financial analysis \u201cunduly confuse\" investors and cause wild swings in its stock.\n\nBut even if the app store's profits are higher than anyone fathomed, that won't necessarily help Epic prove its allegations that Apple is running a monopoly that hurts competition.\n\n\u201cBeing successful is not an antitrust violation in and of itself,\" said Daniel Lyons, a Boston College law professor. \u201cThe argument that your prices are much higher than your costs may play well to a lay audience, but it doesn't hold up legally.\"\n\nFor all the drama, Lyons and other experts say the decision that will ultimately be made by the judge during this non-jury trial will boil down to market definitions. Epic contends the iPhone has become a market by itself, while Apple argues it should also include other devices, including video game consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation that also charge 30% commissions on gaming transactions.\n\n\u201cIf I were a betting man, I would certainly say Apple has the stronger case under existing case law,\" said Larry Downes, project director of Georgetown University's Center for Business and Public Policy. \u201cYou have to put yourself in the standpoint of the consumer, and that's what the judge really has to do. If it's not harming consumers, then this is just a contract dispute between two companies, with one of them trying to use litigation to renegotiate the terms.\"\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",

It retraced some of that move later on Sunday, and was last trading around $0.569 (roughly Rs. 40).\n\nThe billionaire Tesla chief executive hosted the SNL show at 11:30pm EDT on Saturday (9:00am on Sunday IST).\n\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts had for days been eager to see what he would say, after his tweets this year turned the once-obscure digital currency, which began as a social media joke, into a speculator's dream.\n\nAsked 'what is Dogecoin', Musk replied, \"It's the future of currency. It's an unstoppable financial vehicle that's going to take over the world.\"\n\nWhen a show cast member Michael Che countered, \"So, it's a hustle?\", Musk replied, \"Yeah, it's a hustle,\" and laughed.\n\nMusk is the rare business mogul to have been asked to host the venerable comedy TV show. His appearance on the iconic late night show puts Musk back in the spotlight just as Tesla's stock is losing steam following last year's monster rally.\n\nThe unconventional CEO has posted numerous comments about cryptocurrencies on Twitter and criticised regular cash for having negative real interest rates.\n\n\"Only a fool wouldn't look elsewhere,\" he said in February.\n\nHis cryptic tweets \"Doge\" and \"Dogecoin is the people's crypto\" that month kicked off a rally in Dogecoin - created as a parody on the more mainstream Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nOn Thursday, Musk tweeted: \"Cryptocurrency is promising, but please invest with caution!\" with a video clip attached in which he said, \"it should be considered speculation at this point.\"\n\nBut he also said, in the video, that cryptocurrency has a \"good chance\" of becoming what he called \"the future currency of the Earth.\"\n\nSome financial commentators questioned whether it was responsible for Musk to comment on the cryptocurrency, given he has the power to move its price.\n\n\"I think he's having a lot of fun ... He can say anything he wants about Dogecoin or cryptos fully aware that just him saying something moves the price,\" said James Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, who specialises in financial markets and cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Anyone who wants to play the Elon Musk game should be prepared to lose all their money.\"\n\nThe flood of selling appeared to cause problems for popular retail trading platform Robinhood, which tweeted early on Sunday that due to high trading volume and volatility some customers had experienced \"intermittent issues\" trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe company later said the issues had been resolved and that it would contact customers affected by the downtime.\n\nOn crypto data tracker CoinGecko.com, Dogecoin has jumped more than 800 percent over the last month and is now the fourth-largest digital currency, with a market capitalisation of $73 billion (roughly Rs. 5,36,220 crores). It hit a record high Thursday above $0.73 (roughly Rs. 50).\n\nTesla said in February it bought $1.5 billion (roughly Rs. 11,020 crores) worth of Bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment for its electric cars, a large stride toward mainstream acceptance that sent Bitcoin soaring to a record high of nearly $62,000 (roughly Rs. 45.5 lakhs).\n\nTesla shares closed 1.3 percent higher at $672.37 (roughly Rs. 49,00) on Friday.\n\nSome crypto experts said that Sunday's Dogecoin selloff was driven by speculation and that Musk had not hurt its long-term prospects.\n\n\"Long term fundamentals of doge are intact. This is a buying opportunity,\" said Jehan Chu, managing partner at Hong Kong blockchain venture capital firm Kenetic Capital.\n\n\"It's a true social currency - that's its value.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021",

The phone is tipped to measure 148x68.5x8.9mm and weigh approximately 169 grams. There are reported to be three mics on board, and the phone is expected to have dual speakers and support for Nokia's OZO audio technology.\n\nAsus ZenFone 8 series is scheduled to launch on May 12 at 7pm CEST (10:30pm IST). The official microsite hints that the phone will be launched in Berlin, New York, and Taipei. There is no clarity on when the range will launch in India.\n\nWhy did LG give up on its smartphone business? We discussed this on Orbital, the Gadgets 360 podcast.

    "Text": "Foundation\n\nGet ready for the most 2021 sentence of all time: \"The word cheugy is being sold as an NFT.\" If you're not extremely online, very few of those words make sense together. Let me try to explain.\n\nCheugy, pronounced \"chew-gee\", is Gen Z slang popular on social media in general and TikTok in particular. It's used to describe things or people that are out of date or trying too hard, particularly if those things relate to millenials. Essentially, it's how young people dunk on slightly less young people. If you're confused, there is an Instagram account, Cheug Life, created for the specific purpose highlighting cheugy stuff.\n\nDisclaimer: I understand none of this. At 28 years young, I am certainly cheugy.\n\nDecided to do the cheugiest thing possible and make an NFT out of the word cheugy. Place your bids cheugshttps://t.co/fpNFYJigV5 \u2014 cheug-a-roo (@gabyrasson) May 9, 2021\n\nThen there are NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. These are certificates of ownership which are minted on blockchains, unchangeable digital ledgers accessible to everyone. You may remember the blockchain from such hits as \"Bitcoin\" and \"Dogecoin.\" These tokens of ownership can be for anything: Digital art, tweets, pictures, gifs, movies, audio files and, apparently, a word.\n\n\"The collector fo this 1/1 NFT will own a word,\" says Gaby Rasson, the 23-year-old creator of the NFT, who's selling a picture of the word as a nonfungible token. \"I created the word in 2013. At first, it was just me and my high school friends using it. Fast-forward to 2021 and cheugy has gone viral.\n\n\n\nIt is popular with Gen Z.\"\n\nThe beginning price for the auction is 0.1 Ethereum which, with the cryptocurrency surging massively, translates to $396. It will inevitably be bought for more than that as, alarmingly, there is some precedent for this. Kyle Craven, the guy photographed in the \"Bad Luck Brian\" meme, sold the meme as an NFT for $36,000. That's chump change, with the \"Overly Attached Girlfriend\" meme selling for $411,000.\n\nTo be clear, NFTs don't technically allow you to own a word, just a picture denoting the word. Nor do they allow you to own a meme, just a picture of the meme. But it seems in Cryptoland the picture is good enough.\n\nIf you're confused, you're not alone. It's a confusing year for cheugs everywhere.",

    "Text": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nIf you moved within the last year or if you plan to change your address soon, you may need to add one more item to your to-do list: Updating your address with both the IRS and the United States Postal Service. We'll explain why forgetting to change your address can potentially cause you to miss out on thousands of dollars, and we'll walk you through how to update your details.\n\nThere are several reasons why you shouldn't wait to change your address, and it's not just to receive mail at your new residence. The expanded child tax credit and stimulus check payments this year are two important reasons. Since not all post offices forward government checks, you'll need to notify both the USPS and the IRS if you've relocated.\n\nYou have only one week before the May 17 tax deadline to file your 2020 income tax return and to claim this IRS tax refund money from 2017 before it disappears forever. We can also tell you what we know about a fourth stimulus check, how to get a $50 discount on your internet bill and how to get $16,000 back in child care expenses. This story was recently updated.\n\nReason No. 1: Child tax credit payments start in July\n\nThe new child tax credit payments will start going out to those who are eligible in July and arrive monthly through December (and then again next spring) -- calculate your payment here. If you don't have direct deposit set up with the IRS, your payments will likely arrive as paper checks.\n\nHowever, if you've moved recently and you haven't updated your information with the IRS or USPS, it's likely your check could wind up at your old address, potentially causing a delay as you wait for your check to be rerouted. But you'll soon be able to update any incorrect information when the IRS opens a portal designed specifically for the revised child tax credit -- it's expected to open by July.\n\nReason No. 2: Stimulus payments -- especially if you're waiting on a check or EIP card\n\nStimulus checks are still going out as fresh payments and plus-up payments, if the IRS owes you more than it already paid. Also, if you're missing stimulus money, the process to claim it is tied up with your tax return. If you get a tax refund this year and you don't sign up for direct deposit, you'll receive your funds as a paper check from the US Treasury. So you need to make sure that doesn't go to an old address.\n\nAlso, whether or not you have a direct deposit account on file with the government, it's possible you may receive a stimulus check as a paper check or EIP card. This IRS tracking tool can help tell you how you'll get your stimulus money. Once the IRS processes your payment, the final say in how you receive the money is up to the IRS and the Treasury.\n\nYou'll also want to make sure you get the IRS letter verifying when it sent your payment. This is important for anyone who may be eligible for a stimulus check but who experiences an unexpected holdup receiving their money. This IRS notice will be your ticket to settling any errors or submitting a claim for missing money during tax season 2021 (filed in 2022), if it comes down to that.\n\nReason No. 3: Your tax refund, if it's coming in the mail\n\nTax Day is May 17, which is coming up. If you're expecting your tax refund -- and possible missing stimulus money -- to arrive in the mail, make sure the information you input when filing your tax return is correct.\n\nNew address information can be easy to overlook -- especially if you use a tax software program that stores your information for easy filing. If you did update your address in the tax filing system, make sure you also let the USPS know.\n\nPeople who need more time can file a tax extension to Oct. 15, which would also give you more time to file a change-of-address form if you're expecting a refund by mail.\n\nReason No. 4: Preparing for next year's tax refund\n\nIf you've already filed your taxes this year and gotten your refund but you've moved since, now's a good time to update your information in the system. This will save you a step next year and prevent any errors or delays with your next tax refund.\n\nIf you decide to opt out of your child tax credit payments this year, they'll be tied to your tax refund in 2022. You don't want to miss out on a potential $3,600 payment per kid. Add another $16,000 max that you can potentially claim on your taxes next year for any child care expenses you paid this year.\n\nHow to let the IRS know you've moved\n\nOnce you've completed your change of address with USPS (see instructions below), it's time to let the IRS know your new address. Note that it can take four to six weeks for your change of address to be processed by the IRS. Here are your options.\n\nUse your new address when you file your 2020 tax return if you haven't done so yet. The IRS says it will update its records with your new address. If you're typically not required to file taxes and haven't received your stimulus payment, you can still claim your payment as Recovery Rebate Credit on your taxes this year.\n\nIf you already filed your taxes and didn't include your new address, you can notify the IRS of your address change by filling out Form 8822.\n\nLet the IRS know in writing \"the address where you filed your last return\" by giving your full name, your old and new addresses, your Social Security number, individual taxpayer identification number or employer identification number and your signature. The IRS says you can also do this by phone, but it may request additional information.\n\nHow to forward your mail to a new address through USPS\n\n\n\nWhen you move, it's important to forward your mail so don't miss any important documents -- including a stimulus check. Here's how to do it.\n\n1. Go to usps.com/move.\n\n2. Fill out the form with your contact information, the date you'd like the mail to start forwarding and the details of your old and new addresses. Make sure everything is accurate and click Next when you're ready to move on.\n\n3. Then, you'll need to provide a payment method. It costs $1.05 each time you forward your mailing address. Note that you can't use a prepaid credit or debit card to do this. (Here is some additional information on the topic.)\n\n4. Once you've paid, you'll receive an email confirmation that your change of address has been filed.\n\n5. At your new address, look for a USPS Confirmation Notification Letter and welcome kit in the mail. USPS says it can take anywhere from three business days to two weeks before you start receiving your forwarded mail.\n\nFor more information, here's who qualifies for the new child tax credit. Also, here's how you could get a $10,200 tax break from the IRS and what to know about the $300 weekly unemployment benefits.",

    "Text": "Netflix\n\nWriting the biggest characters in comics may be a dream come true, but even Marvel icon Stan Lee didn't recommend hanging on to the gig forever. In fact, he advised Jupiter's Legacy creator Mark Millar to strike out on his own. Several comics and one multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix later, the Jupiter's Legacy TV series is here to challenge Marvel's onscreen adventures.\n\nBased on a comic by Millar and artist Frank Quitely, Jupiter's Legacy is an eight-part series streaming on Netflix now. It features superheroes like the Utopian, Lady Liberty and Skyfox who provide a character-driven spin on archetypal heroes like Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman.\n\nJupiter's Legacy arrives in a crowded market. We've got the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and TV series, the DCEU and Arrowverse, Venom, The Boys, Watchmen, Invincible, Project Powers and Thunder Force... the list of superpowered series and sequels goes on. Millar thought about that crowded market even when he conceived the original comic. \"I'd just done Marvel's biggest books,\" he recalls, \"I'd done Kick-Ass, and if I was going to do another superhero story it had to be the greatest superhero story of all time.\"\n\n\"I was aware that I was never going to own Marvel and DC stuff,\" Millar told me in a Zoom call from his home in Scotland. From the early days of comics, when writers and artists weren't even credited, to today, when their chapters spawn multibillion-dollar media franchises, \"work for hire\" has always been a thorny subject. Most recently, writer Ed Brubaker lamented that he'd seen no remuneration for creating Marvel's Winter Soldier even after the character headlined a Disney Plus TV series.\n\nSteve Wilkie/Netflix\n\nMillar worked on The Ultimates and Civil War comics, both of which explicitly laid foundations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but he feels he got something out of the deal. \"After writing Marvel's biggest books, I had an audience I could siphon off,\" he notes -- and the success of his own creations like Kick-Ass and Kingsman led to a \u00a325 million ($31 million) sale of his Millarworld production company to Netflix in 2017.\n\nIt turns out Millar's work for Marvel and DC was good practice for creating the world of Jupiter's Legacy. This expansive superhero superhistory spanned from 1929 to the distant future, encompassing huge numbers of characters across multiple timelines. \"I just thought I'm going to treat everything I've done up to this point as a training exercise,\" Millar says.\n\nMillar was involved with adapting Jupiter's Legacy through the writing process and then, after filming, six months of editing. Lockdown filming restrictions have reportedly stalled The Magic Order, Millar's other show in development with Netflix, but Jupiter's Legacy had largely finished shooting in Toronto when the coronavirus hit, apart from reshoots in January.\n\nAdam Rose/Netflix\n\nThe pandemic meant Millar could be involved with the edit from his home in Scotland without having to shave, get dressed or fly over to LA. In fact, he was able to screen the work in progress -- moving the TV into the garden due to COVID restrictions -- to gauge reactions from family and friends. \"The trouble is most of Glasgow has now seen it,\" he laughs.\n\nOriginally, Millar considered adapting the comic series into a movie, but Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn pointed out it was more suited to a 40-hour TV series. In fact, season 1 follows two plot lines: the superheroes in the present day and their origin story in 1929 told in flashbacks. That origin story is laid out very quickly in the first few pages of the comic, and when Millar conceived a movie version he would have quickly dispatched that plotline before the credits. But for the TV version, showrunner Steven DeKnight suggested expanding the backstory instead.\n\nMillar compares the result to Steven Spielberg's film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It's a risky move and could alienate readers who know where the storyline is going, but Millar says he couldn't be happier with the decision -- and notes that season 1 only uses elements from the first couple of issues of the comic. \"We've got a ton of stuff we could do if we make a season 2,\" he says.\n\nDespite the competition, Millar doesn't think we're going to tire of superheroes anytime soon.\n\n\"When times are tough people turn to superheroes,\" he says. \"Superman was created by two Jewish kids in the Depression when World War II was looming, then in the Cold War the Marvel Universe was all about radioactivity when atomic war was looming over everywhere. ... When you see stuff on the news that's terrifying, you want to see Spider-man save everyone.\"",

The IRS estimates 1.3 million taxpayers have $1.3 billion worth of unclaimed 2017 tax refunds it is waiting to deliver. If you didn't file a federal income tax return for 2017, time is running out: You have a little over a week to file for your refund. After May 17 -- Tax Day this year -- those unclaimed 2017 tax refunds will become the property of the US Department of Treasury.\n\nWith Tax Day moved to May 17 this year, the IRS is still busy processing tax returns along with sending weekly batches of stimulus checks and \"plus-up\" payments along with getting ready to send as soon as July the first of the expanded child tax credit payments.\n\nWe'll show you how to see if the IRS has an income tax refund you need to claim. For more, here's how to get back $16,000 in child care expenses, how to save $50 on your internet bill, see if your state has unclaimed money it owes you and what you want to know about child tax credit payments. This story is frequently updated.\n\nWhen is the deadline to claim an older income tax refund?\n\nThe IRS is required to hold on to unclaimed tax refunds for three years. By law, if you do not file for a refund after three years, the money becomes the property of the US Treasury, and you will not be able to get it. For a 2017 income tax refund, you need to claim by Tax Day (May 17) before it's gone.\n\nHow do I find out if the IRS has an unclaimed tax refund for me?\n\nThe only way to know if the IRS is holding your refund is to file a return for the year, the IRS said. The agency regularly estimates the dollar amount of unreported tax returns but can't determine if an individual taxpayer is due a refund until they file a tax return. The Where's My Refund tool can't help either. It reports the refund status of those who have already filed their taxes.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Child tax credit: How much are you getting?\n\nHow do I claim my tax refund?\n\nTo claim a refund for 2017, you need to submit your 2017 tax form, either online or through the mail. If you are mailing it, the tax return needs to be postmarked by May 17. Note that you may need to file a 2018 and 2019 tax return too for the IRS to release your 2017 refund.\n\nWhat if I'm missing documents for my 2017 taxes?\n\nYou can find a prior year's tax forms on the IRS' forms page. If you are missing a W-2, 1098, 1099 or 5498 from 2017, the IRS recommends you request a copy from your employer or bank. You can also order a free wage and income transcript from the IRS and then use the information on the transcript to file your tax return.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nCan my unclaimed refund be used to cover debt?\n\nIf you think you were due a refund from 2017 but you don't receive one after your file, all or part of your refund may have been offset, or used to pay off past-due federal tax, state income tax, state unemployment compensation debts, child support, spousal support or other federal debts such as student loans.\n\nFor more information about your 2020 taxes, here's how to claim missing stimulus money on your taxes and how to track your tax fund this year.",

Mattel is taking back old Barbie, Matchbox and Mega toys for free as part of a new toy recycling program called Mattel PlayBack. Consumers can print out a free shipping label to mail their outgrown toys back to the California company \u2014 and have the parts reused to make future products.\n\nThe new recycling program is the latest step Mattel is taking to become more sustainable and reach its goal of having 100 percent recycled, recyclable or bio-based plastic materials across all products and packaging by 2030.\n\nTo get a free shipping label for qualifying toys, go to Mattel's official site and click the \"Get Started\" button. The label will be emailed to you one hour after submitting your request.\n\nYou'll need to supply your own box to mail out the toys. But you don't need to worry about cleaning or repairing the toys before sending them back. (Mattel just asks that you do remove the batteries.)\n\nMattel will sort through the toys collected, separate them by material type, then have them processed. For materials that can't be repurposed in new toys, Mattel announced it will either turn them into other plastic products or covert it from waste to energy.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Barbie at 60 is a tech and science wiz\n\nWe're already seeing Mattel make toys from eco-friendly materials. Three Mega Bloks sets last year were made from plant-based plastics, along with Fisher-Price's baby blocks and ring stack set. There's also a version of the card game Uno called \"Nothin' But Paper,\" which is the first fully recyclable Uno deck without cellophane wrap.\n\nAnd last month, Matchbox began showing off its own tiny Tesla Roadster, the first die-cast vehicle made from 99% recycled materials and certified CarbonNeutral. It's available to buy in 2022. (And yes, even the packaging is recyclable and compostable.)\n\nMattel\n\nMattel is not the only toymaker aiming to go green. Lego has a program called Lego Replay to donate used bricks to children's nonprofits in the US. And Hasbro partners with TerraCycle to offer its consumers a free shipping label to mail off and responsibly dispose of Hasbro toys and games. And Hasbro is phasing out plastic from its packaging, as well.\n\nMattel's program is first launching in the United States and Canada, but similar take back programs for Mattel toys will also be coming to France, Germany and the UK.\n\nRight now, only Barbie, Matchbox and Mega toys are included in the program. But the company says it wants to eventually expand the program to accept any Mattel toy.\n\nSo maybe all those orange Hot Wheels tracks will soon get the green treatment, too.",

In comments helpfully translated by a Twitter user, Nomura noted several times that development is going smoothly and also said \"Cloud will be running around a lot of nature,\" which fans have taken to mean that Part 2 will be less linear that Remake.\n\nSmall details like these are big news for Final Fantasy fans, who are used to enduring long delays between games and years without any news. Final Fantasy 15 took 10 years to develop and there was 5 years between Final Fantasy 7 Remake's reveal and release, making some fans question how long the wait between Remake and Part 2 would be.

(This is no small detail, since mini games within Final Fantasy titles are often awesome.)\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is a free upgrade for players who own Remake on the PlayStation 4, although the new trailer stresses that those who downloaded the game for free as a PlayStation Plus perk don't count. A disclaimer at the trailer's end also noted that the game will be a PlayStation 5 exclusive for six months, which could mean Yuffie's mission will become available to PS4 owners -- or that the entire game will migrate to Xbox.",

    "Text": "HBO Max\n\nHBO Max has even more to offer than the already excellent selection of shows in HBO's premium library. A few gems of original content and co-productions with other networks bring fresh stories -- from the glorious I Hate Suzie, to the brilliant weirdness of Search Party. Here are the best of the bunch.\n\nRead more: The 8 best movies to watch on HBO Max | Everything you need to know to sign up to HBO Max\n\nVeneno HBO Max HBO Max thankfully brings this lauded Spanish miniseries to screens around the world. Veneno chronicles the life of Spanish icon Cristina Ortiz Rodr\u00edguez, a transgender singer and '90s TV personality better known by the nickname \"La Veneno\" or \"poison\" in Spanish. Her enigmatic story comes under the lens of a curious journalism student grappling with her own identity. By turns hilarious, explicit and heart-breaking, this must-watch biographical miniseries explores survival and the influence of mass media.\n\nInfinity Train HBO Max Not a fan of cartoons? Let Infinity Train change your mind -- all four seasons of the critically acclaimed show explore complex themes through character-driven storylines. Season 1 follows Tulip Olsen, a girl struggling with her parents' recent divorce. Along with her pals -- a confused robot and a talking corgi -- she explores a seemingly endless train, whose passengers all have unresolved emotional issues or trauma. How do they leave the train? By resolving their issues, of course. Dark, challenging and magnificent, this is animated viewing like you've rarely seen it. Definitely not just for kids.\n\nMade for Love HBO Max Black Mirror, but there's light at the end of the tunnel. This satirical comedy hinges on Cristin Milioti's comedic talents. Hazel Green escapes a 10-year marriage -- until she realizes her husband, a tech billionaire, has fitted a chip into her brain. He can see her every move and track her down to negotiate their marriage. Hazel searches for freedom with the help of her dad, played by Ray Romano, who's in an unorthodox relationship of his own. A few twists, a helpful dolphin and socially awkward people also tag along for this disturbing ride.\n\nHBO Max Raised by Wolves will satisfy those who want to spend a lot of time (nearly 10 hours) in a world brought to the screen with the help of Ridley Scott. Two androids, Mother and Father, attempt to establish an atheist human colony on a new planet, after a war with a religious order destroys Earth. But they soon discover controlling the beliefs of humans is a tricky task. Directing the first two episodes, as well as pulling the strings as an executive producer, Scott sets up a provocative exploration into AI and religious beliefs. There's blood, big performances and a powerful lead in Amanda Collin's \"Mother.\"\n\nHBO Max This compulsive thriller starring Kaley Cuoco is one of the best new shows to come out of HBO Max. Cuoco plays Cassie, a reckless flight attendant who sleeps with a passenger on a wild night out. She wakes up in Bangkok with barely any memory -- and a dead body in bed with her. With the ghost of the deceased helping her piece things back together, she sobers up and takes on the mystery of what happened. Watch out for a fantastic title sequence, as well as a surprisingly dark psychological layer. But mainly enjoy the amusing combination of an inept detective bumbling through the world of cold killers.\n\nHBO Max Love Life is an anthology series that focuses on a different character's love life until they meet the person they're meant to be with. The first chapter follows Anna Kendrick's Darby, an aspiring art collector who dates a range of different men with complicated results. Love Life paints a refreshingly imperfect picture, traveling a long, messy road that ultimately offers a hopeful look at relationships.\n\nHBO Max The best TV show of 2021 might already be here. It's a Sin follows a group of young gay men living in London during the '80s, just when HIV/AIDS was first diagnosed. This unique look at the early stages of what became a death sentence is handled with creator Russell T Davies' trademark irrepressible joy for life. The warm, empathetic characters continue to live their lives to the full, flitting between bustling share houses and local bars to the beat of a popping '80s soundtrack. Fast-paced, stylish and eye-opening, with a prevailing sense of hope, It's a Sin is a soaring triumph for everyone to fall in love with.\n\nHBO Max Search Party caught the eye of HBO Max, shifting to production with the streamer in its third and fourth seasons. The latter is arguably its best yet, taking the story of four, clueless millennials to even greater extremes, including a bizarrely brilliant Susan Sarandon cameo. But we begin when twenty-something Dory becomes an amateur detective to track down a missing woman she barely knew in college. Really, she's searching for something else: Herself. Equally conceited are her boyfriend Drew, the scene-stealing Elliott and the hilariously blonde Portia. This oddball show somehow creates the perfect cocktail of dark humour, mystery and insane characters. A collector's item that won't come around very often.\n\nHBO Max From the minds of the gang behind Horrible Histories comes Ghosts, a sitcom that manages to become better and better with every episode. The ever-reliable Charlotte Ritchie (Feel Good, Call The Midwife) stars as Alison, a woman doing up the old mansion she inherited with the help of her amateur builder husband. On top of money problems, their reno plans aren't helped by the ghostly residents who want the house to themselves. If you're on the look out for purely light-hearted viewing, Ghosts delivers a high gag rate, a talented comedic ensemble and even an endearing arc of friendship. Most of all, it's gleefully silly.\n\nHBO Max This comedy-drama about a Syrian asylum seeker leans heavily on the warmer, cosier side of the equation. It follows the lives of a British family after they return from a holiday in France and discover a passenger hiding in the back of their car. There's endless charm in Sami's fish-out-of-water hijinks as he adapts to his new home. Home mines that feel-good vein, filled with nice people willing to help a good man, even if that's a struggle for some of the family members.\n\nHBO Max Stath Lets Flats is one of the best new British TV shows that trades in quintessentially absurd British humor. Stath is a socially inept Greek-Cypriot letting agent, whose dad hands him a job working for his company. Despite his ineptitude, Stath perseveres with his new vocation, showing flats to potential customers with the electricity cut off or with the security alarm blaring because he can't remember the code. His attempts to impress his father burn the same cringe appeal as The Office, which also sprinkled in poignant moments ensuring you rooted for the characters. Stick around for the even better season 2, which won three BAFTAs.\n\nHBO Max This black comedy takes us from London to Newcastle, Australia, following the misfortune of a woman who loses everything after the untimely death of her husband (don't ask how he died). Broke and desperate, Sammy is forced to return to her hometown with her son and daughter, where she soon discovers she isn't exactly a popular resident. The cringe factor is strong as Sammy does everything in her power to return to London, with some standout moments when she reunites with her bickering brother.\n\nHBO Max Based on a memoir, Pure isn't your average coming-of-age comedy about a young woman newly-moved to London. Marnie struggles with a form of OCD called Pure O, which causes her to have intrusive sexual thoughts, often in the worst moments. (Her own mother features in one of these thoughts -- no wonder Marnie leaves home.) What Pure does best is address stereotypes about OCD in compassionate ways: Marnie traverses the same stresses as other twenty-somethings -- a new job, her sexuality and friendship. An enlightening, relatable and essential comedy.\n\nHBO Max I Hate Suzie sees Billie Piper team up once again with Secret Diary of a Call Girl writer Lucy Prebble. The result is a frenetic tour de force of ideas, steered by a vulnerable performance from Piper. She plays the titular Suzie, an actress who, moments after winning a part in a Disney movie, discovers she's one of the victims in a celebrity phone hacking scandal. Each episode explores a stage of trauma, tackling the question of how compromising leaks both upend and perhaps liberate a person's life. Amid the ruthless satire is a wonderful friendship between Suzie and her manager Naomi (Leila Farzad).",

A standout: Sound of Metal, the recent Oscar winner for best sound and film editing, with a career best performance from Riz Ahmed (it scored him a best actor nod). A few lesser-known flicks make this list, too, starring big names, like Joaquin Phoenix in You Were Never Really Here. Note: Some films on this list might not feature on Amazon in your country -- apologies and here's a handy VPN guide.\n\nRead more: 22 best TV shows to watch on Amazon Prime Video | Everything you need to know to sign up to Amazon Prime Video\n\nUncle Frank Amazon Need more Paul Bettany in your life? Of course you do, especially since WandaVision is done and dusted. Try Uncle Frank, a road flick set in the '70s about a gay man and his relationship with his family, including niece and college student Beth (Sophia Lillis from the It movies and I Am Not Okay With This). The pair drive across America to attend a funeral, Frank grappling with whether to let his parter Wally (Peter Macdissi) come along. A comedy with sharp edges, Uncle Frank ultimately leaves you on an assuringly positive note.\n\nGet Duked! Amazon Studios A teen comedy-horror-thriller with a dash of social commentary. What a combo! Get Duked! follows three slacker students, one nerd and their mundane teacher as they head to the Scottish Highlands to attempt to win an award involving navigating the area using just a paper map. Everything becomes a little more thrilling when the four teens end up fending for themselves against murderous hunter the Duke, played by the brilliant Eddie Izzard. The whole young ensemble is fantastic, playing with a tight script crackling with banter. Boy Scouts meets Attack the Block, Get Duked! is chaos walking, cussing and eating questionable local flora.\n\nSound of Metal Amazon Studios Sound of Metal just scored a bunch of Oscar nominations, including best picture and actor for the outstanding Riz Ahmed. He plays Ruben, a punk-metal drummer who unfortunately starts to lose his hearing. As well as struggling with a drug addiction, Ruben is forced to settle into his new life in the deaf community and to learn American Sign Language. The film's stunning sound design, also nominated for an Oscar, immerses you in Ruben's suspenseful story and the experiences of those around him.\n\nSmall Axe Amazon A sublime anthology that doesn't drop the ball across its five films. Small Axe is a collection of distinct stories about the lives of West Indian immigrants in London from the '60s to the '80s. They're all directed by Steve McQueen, who's working at his exquisite best (when doesn't he?), crafting stories such as courtroom drama Mangrove, based on the 1971 trial of the Mangrove Nine and starring Black Panther's Letitia Wright. Take a seat and devour this massive achievement.\n\nSylvie's Love Amazon While Sylvie's Love is, at its core, an old-fashioned love story, its dewy romance is remarkably refreshing: a period drama centered on Black people that isn't dominated by issues of race and bigotry. Set in an aesthetically enchanting '60s New York City, it follows Sylvie and Robert, who have a chance to reconnect after a summer romance five years earlier. Both work in music, and the film's soundtrack, featuring Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and more, helps transport you to this glowing place.\n\nI'm Your Woman Amazon Not your usual crime thriller, I'm Your Woman follows the perspective of a mobster's wife, played by The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's Rachel Brosnahan. A betrayal forces Jean to go on the run with a newborn baby and a bodyguard, her husband's former associate Cal (Arinz\u00e9 Kene). The '70s-set neo-noir circles around themes like racial tensions, privilege and survival. It moves along at a surprisingly steady pace, giving you time to absorb the powerful psychological impact of Jean's new situation.\n\nThe 12 Lives of Sissy Carlyle Amazon This crowdfunded film is a bundle of quirky, feel-good adventures in a sweet 90-minute hit. After a tragic loss, 27-year-old antique shop owner Sissy Carlyle retreats into her inner world, imagining 11 different, exciting lives that she details in her journals. But eventually she questions whether to shed her fantasy cocoon and face stark realities, which might not be as hopeless as they once seemed. Uplifting is the word to describe Sissy's ultimate adventure in The 12 Lives of Sissy Carlyle.\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm Amazon Prime Video Nearly 15 years after Kazakh journalist and TV personality Borat first graced our big screens, he's back playing pranks on unsuspecting Americans while delivering some incredibly incisive cultural commentary. In Borat 2, or Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, Borat's on a trip to the US to offer his daughter Tutar (played by a revelatory Maria Bakalova) to Vice President Mike Pence during the 2020 presidential election -- and the COVID-19 pandemic. Prepare to cringe at the doubled-down political incorrectness before succumbing to the outrageous laughs.\n\nSelah and the Spades Amazon If you're into the dark-things-happen-at-boarding-schools genre, then Selah and the Spades might be the subject to sign up for. A senior leads a faction called the Spades who sell drugs to other students. But Selah's about to graduate, so must find the right candidate to carry on her legacy. Shot beautifully and guided by debut director Tayarisha Poe's unique lens, this is a taste of even greater things to come.\n\nAmazon The Big Sick introduced the world to Kumail Nanjiani, who co-wrote the movie based on his real-life romance with partner Emily V. Gordon. After the pair go on a few promising dates, Emily inexplicably falls ill and must be placed in an induced coma. While Kumail gets to know her worried parents at the hospital, his own Pakistani family keeps arranging dates for him with other women. Not only ripe for cultural comedy setups, The Big Sick is also a down-to-earth and heartfelt story of an interracial couple.\n\nAmazon Studios A psychological thriller starring a pre-Joker Joaquin Phoenix? Yeah, more people need to watch You Were Never Really Here. Lynne Ramsay's masterful take on a story about a hitman who's hired to rescue a politician's daughter from a human trafficking network, is stark, brutal and mercifully straight to the point, running at a taut 90 minutes. With Phoenix doing his brilliant committed actor thing, You Were Never Really Here is more than your average thriller.\n\nAmazon An enjoyable comedy, yes, but Brittany Runs a Marathon also hits close to home, focusing on the things we're all obsessed with: food, body image and exercise. Brittany, played by the effortlessly relatable Jillian Bell, receives strong advice from her doctor to lose weight and cut the hard-partying lifestyle. She starts running, taking all the tough steps toward the life-changing finish line. Watch it from your couch, then be inspired to head outside for a jog.\n\nAmazon Studios Luca Guadagnino's horror picture framed in a bleak, art house window won't be for everyone, but for those who go down the rabbit hole of its prestigious Berlin dance school, you're in for a twisted treat. Tilda Swinton is the majestic lead teacher, who mentors young ingenue Dakota Johnson. Be warned: The flexible dancers bring new contortions to body horror. It's a long movie, at over two and a half hours, but if you're into disturbing visuals and a touch of witchcraft, there are a couple of jaw-dropping scenes you'll want to stick around for.\n\nAmazon Studios Based on the life of British adventurer Percy Fawcett, The Lost City of Z drops you into the Amazon Rainforest on the search for an ancient lost city. If that setup for adventure isn't enticing enough, the movie stars Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson and Tom Holland... with a mustache. A beautiful, grandiose film put together with great care, The Lost City of Z might move slower than you think, but that only enhances its fascinating psychological layers.\n\nAmazon Studios Prepare for Amazon's first big, prestigious movie to wallop you in the chest. A broken man who's experienced terrible losses becomes the guardian of his teenage nephew. Lee Chandler's story will hit you with punch after emotional punch, as will the immense performances from the likes of Michelle Williams. Another accomplishment from Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea is full-bodied, unforgettable storytelling.\n\nAmazon Studios Even if you've heard good things about The Handmaiden, nothing can prepare you for the insane twists this exquisite South Korean movie takes. Classed as an erotic psychological thriller, The Handmaiden contains explicit scenes you should probably avoid watching with parents around. It all kicks off with a con man wooing a Japanese heiress with the intention of committing her to an asylum once they're married. But his pickpocket partner who poses as her maid strays from the plan. If you've been getting into South Korean films thanks to Parasite, this is a must watch.\n\nAmazon Studios In trademark Jim Jarmusch style, this low-key indie narrows in on the finer details of regular life with a distinct sense of humor. Spanning one week, Paterson follows a bus driver and poet named Paterson who listens to passengers talking, takes his dog for walks and stops for beers at his local bar. Adam Driver alone makes all that endlessly watchable. Dotted with the idiosyncratic characters living in a New Jersey town, Paterson offers a wise take on life, delving into personal setbacks and the new paths weaved around them.\n\nAmazon Studios Written by and starring Mindy Kaling, Late Night follows an acclaimed news show host whose ratings are on the decline. She hires a female, Indian-American writer to shake up her white-male writer's room. Never preachy, while making an argument for transforming Emma Thompson into a real-life talk show host, Late Night is lively comedy with hints of The Devil Wears Prada. That alone should be a solid reason to watch it.\n\nAmazon Studios Following lovers from different backgrounds and temperaments, Pawel Pawlikowski's historical drama is set in a ravaged, post-World War II Poland. Zula is an ambitious young singer faking a peasant identity, while Wiktor is a jazz musician holding auditions for a state-sponsored folk music ensemble. The politics are handled elegantly and the black-and-white visuals are precise and beautiful. For an 88-minute treat of a sumptuous, passionate, almost impossible love story, look no further than Cold War.\n\nAmazon Studios The Vast of Night is a curious indie sci-fi flick from debut director Andrew Patterson that plays with narrative in clever ways. Long, sweeping shots carry us after two young radio workers who investigate an audio frequency they think could be traced to aliens. The distinctive 1950s New Mexico setting, and characters delivering monologues with the smooth intonations of those on radio, all build an eerie atmosphere with satisfying payoff.\n\nAmazon Studios Shia LaBeouf wrote the screenplay for this autobiographical movie about a child actor and his relationship with his father. We follow Otis, who's traumatized after days on set accompanied by his father, a former rodeo clown. LaBeouf actually plays the character inspired by his father, giving Honey Boy even more psychological layers. This is fascinating, cinematic therapy from a singular perspective.\n\nAmazon Studios I Am Not Your Negro is a documentary narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and inspired by a collection of notes and letters written by American writer and activist James Baldwin in the mid-'70s. The subject of these memoirs? His close friends, the revolutionary civil rights leaders Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers. Exploring the history of racism in the US, I Am Not Your Negro spotlights, through Baldwin's observations, the painful struggle for civil rights.\n\nAmazon Studios One Child Nation gives you an illuminating look at China's one-child policy, which lasted from 1979 to 2015. Its directors, Nanfu Wang and Jialing Zhang, were born during this period and explore the aftereffects of what had become a normal aspect of life for Chinese people. Looking at the unpleasant side of the \"population war\" through the experiences of a wide variety of people, One Child Nation is a stark illustration of this period of Chinese history.",

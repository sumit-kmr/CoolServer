    "Text": "A few weeks ago, NASA awarded a contract to SpaceX for $2.9 billion to use Starship to take astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon. The contract is part of the Artemis program, and NASA had been expected to choose more than one company to build a moon lander, mirroring the approach the space agency has used for hiring companies to take cargo and now astronauts to the International Space Station.\n\nAfter the announcement, NASA\u2019s decision was challenged by the two other companies that were competing for the contract: Blue Origin, the private company founded by Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon; and Dynetics, a defense contractor in Huntsville, Ala. NASA has now instructed SpaceX to halt work on the lunar Starship until the Government Accountability Office makes a decision on the protests. The challenge does not affect SpaceX\u2019s work on the Starship models currently being tested in Texas.\n\nMr. Musk\u2019s company has become successful in the launch business, and it is now one of the world\u2019s most valuable privately held companies. Its Falcon 9 rockets have become a dominant workhorse for sending satellites into orbit. It routinely transports cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station. In the last month, it has launched four astronauts to the space station for NASA, and later brought home another crew in a nighttime splashdown on Saturday.\n\nHowever, many are skeptical of Mr. Musk\u2019s assertion that the company is just a few years from sending a Starship to Mars, noting that he has repeatedly set timelines for SpaceX that proved far too optimistic.\n\nIn 2019, when he provided an update on the development of Starship, he said that a high-altitude test would occur within months and that orbital flights could occur early in 2020.\n\nInstead, several catastrophic failures happened because of faulty welding. When the propellant tanks stopped rupturing, two of the prototypes made short successful flights last year. Those earlier Starship prototypes resembled spray paint cans with their labels removed, rising nearly 500 feet using a single rocket engine before setting back down at the Texas test site.\n\nAlthough it has lifted off the ground many times, Starship is a long way from being ready for a trip to orbit. But SpaceX already has its eyes on future tests that will send subsequent Starship prototypes to much greater altitudes. In March, Mr. Musk shared a picture of a prototype of the large booster stage that will be needed for a trip to space. It is over 200 feet tall.",

    "Text": "Several parts of the world \u2014 including India and Brazil \u2014 are still being severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. However, some regions are coming back to a sense of normalcy and people are at least thinking about going back to life as we knew it. In such times, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has sent an email to Google employees detailing how the company plans to bring employees back to offices.\n\nIn his email, Pichai wrote that Google is \u201ctesting new multi-purpose offices and private workspaces, and working with teams to develop advanced video technology that creates greater equity between employees in the office and those joining virtually.\u201d\n\nGoogle, as per Pichai, will move to a hybrid week culture. \u201cWe\u2019ll move to a hybrid work weak where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best.\u201d\n\nThe company expects about 60% of Google employees to come to offices together, 20% to work from new office locations whereas the rest 20% will continue working from home.\n\n\u201cI am profoundly optimistic that once we do, we will be able to come back together in our offices to see all the people we have missed. And we\u2019ll be able to work together in entirely new ways that improve both our work and our lives,\u201d noted Pichai in his email.\n\nHere\u2019s the full email Pichai wrote to the employees:\n\nHi Googlers,\n\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year focused on supporting employees during the pandemic. I hope the extra benefits such as Carer \u2019s Leave, the work-from-home allowance, the extra reset days, and the ability to work from wherever you need have been helpful in getting through this tough time.\n\nAnd we\u2019re not through it yet. It\u2019s heartbreaking to see COVID surging in places like India, Brazil, and many others around the world. If you live in one of these places, please focus on taking care of yourselves and your loved ones right now. We are here to support however we can.\n\nIn other areas, conditions are less dire and people are beginning to open up their lives and think about returning to the office. In fact, in places where we\u2019ve been able to reopen Google offices in a voluntary capacity, we\u2019ve seen nearly 60% of Googlers choosing to come back to the office.\n\nFor more than 20 years, our employees have been coming to the office to solve interesting problems \u2014 in a cafe, around a whiteboard, or during a pickup game of beach volleyball or cricket. Our campuses have been at the heart of our Google community and the majority of our employees still want to be on campus some of the time. Yet many of us would also enjoy the flexibility of working from home a couple days of week, spending time in another city for part of the year, or even moving there permanently. Google\u2019s future workplace will have room for all of these possibilities.\n\nOver the last year, a team within REWS has been reimagining a hybrid workplace to help us collaborate effectively across many work environments. They\u2019re testing new multi-purpose offices and private workspaces, and working with teams to develop advanced video technology that creates greater equity between employees in the office and those joining virtually. All of these efforts will help us work with greater flexibility and choice once we\u2019re able to return to our offices globally.\n\nThat flexibility will come in a few different forms \u2014 and your product areas and functions will share more details on all of these changes by mid-June. Here are the key principles:\n\nA more flexible work week:\n\nWe\u2019ll move to a hybrid work week where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best. Since in-office time will be focused on collaboration, your product areas and functions will help decide which days teams will come together in the office. There will also be roles that may need to be on site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work.\n\nMore choice around where you work:\n\nMore locations globally: One of Google's biggest advantages is our global footprint. We are investing in many great communities globally \u2014 which creates more opportunity for employees to move around throughout their careers. By mid-June your PAs and functions will come back with a process by which you can apply to move to another office. In granting approvals, they\u2019ll take into account whether business goals can be met in the new location and whether your team has the right infrastructure in the site to support your work.\n\nRemote work: We\u2019ll also offer opportunities for you to apply for completely remote work (away from your team or office) based on your role and team needs. Before the pandemic, we had thousands of people working in locations separate from their core teams. I fully expect those numbers to increase in the coming months as we develop more remote roles, including fully all-remote sub teams. You\u2019ll be able to apply for remote work within your product area or function. As with location transfers, your leads will evaluate whether remote work can support the goals of the team and business. Whether you choose to transfer to a different office or opt for completely remote work, your compensation will be adjusted according to your new location.\n\nTaken together these changes will result in a workforce where around 60% of Googlers are coming together in the office a few days a week, another 20% are working in new office locations, and 20% are working from home.\n\nMore flexibility for your life:\n\nWork-from-anywhere weeks: Going forward, Googlers will be able to temporarily work from a location other than their main office for up to 4 weeks per year (with manager approval). The goal here is to give everyone more flexibility around summer and holiday travel.\n\nFocus time: Product areas and functions will also offer focus hours so we limit internal meetings during times when people need to be heads down on projects.\n\nReset days: We\u2019ll continue offering extra \u201creset\u201d days to help employees recharge during the pandemic in 2021. Our next global day off will be on Friday, May 28 (or the following work day if you\u2019re already not working on the 28th). Please enjoy it!\n\nI know this past year hasn\u2019t been easy for anyone and many Googlers are still suffering as the pandemic wears on. We will get through it \u2014 together \u2014 as a Google community.\n\nI am profoundly optimistic that once we do, we will be able to come back together in our offices to see all the people we have missed. And we\u2019ll be able to work together in entirely new ways that improve both our work and our lives.\n\nThe future of work is flexibility. The changes above are a starting point to help us do our very best work and have fun doing it.\n\nLook forward to continuing the conversation with all of you.\n\nSundar\n\n",

    "Text": "NEW DELHI: OnePlus launched its first smartwatch -- OnePlus Watch \u2014 in India with its latest OnePlus 9 series of smartphones. Last month the company announced that it will soon bring Always-on display on the smartwatch.\n\nNow, keeping to its promise the smartphone maker has started rolling out a software update which brings, Always-On display on the OnePlus Watch. But the inclusion of this feature will affect the battery life of the smartwatch.\n\nThe inclusion of Always-On display will decrease the battery life of the wearable as the screen will constantly remain on. This also means that the battery life will be reduced to half. So, after installing the update, it is possible that the OnePlus Watch will be able to deliver only 7 days of battery backup instead of 14 days.\n\nAlong with the Always-On display, the latest update also brings Marathon workout mode and fixes some issues which promise to improve the system stability.\n\nOnePlus Watch specifications\n\nOnePlus Watch features a 1.39-inch OLED display with 454\u00d7454 pixel resolution. As confirmed by the company, the OnePlus Watch uses RTOS style software the same as the one you will see in smartwatches from Amazfit. Users will also be able to connect the smartwatch with the OnePlus TV and also use it as a remote. The device comes with an IP68 rating which makes it dust and water-resistant.\n\nThe OnePlus Watch offers features like sleep monitoring, air pressure monitoring and blood oxygen level monitoring. The wearable also offers 110 workout modes which include walking, jogging, running, marathon, outdoor cycling, indoor cycling, freestyle training, swimming and more.\n\nThe company also confirmed that users will be able to track all health data using the OnePlus health app. The smartwatch also packs 4GB internal storage.\n\nThe OnePlus Watch comes with Wrap Charge fast charging support. The company claims that the smartwatch will offer a week's battery life with 20 minutes of charging.\n\n",

The new game is projected to be exclusive to India, and its logo will feature the tri-colour theme to attract Indian mobile gamers.\n\n\u201cKrafton will collaborate with partners to build an esports ecosystem while bringing in-game content regularly, starting with a series of India specific in-game events at launch, to be announced later,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe company also claimed that all data collection and storage of Battlegrounds Mobile India will be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in India and for players in the country. This could be in response to the government concerns over data privacy and security on PUBG Mobile that eventually led to its ban in September last year.",

    "Text": "Europe's first 3D-printed concrete house and the world's first commercial housing project in the city of Eindhoven has gotten its first tenants. With Project Milestone, the city of Eindhoven hopes to pave the way for wide-scale construction of 3D houses equipped with all modern comforts. The three-room single-floor house is spread over 1,000 square feet and has a wooden roof. Shaped like a boulder, it is surrounded by greenery and open space on each side. Four more houses are to be readied under the Milestone Project at the location being developed as a \u201csculpture garden\u201d.\n\nThese houses are intended to be occupied for at least several decades, according to information available on the project's website. The builders say the 3D printing technology gives them freedom, whereas the traditional concrete designing was very rigid. They say that one of the advantages of using a 3D concrete printer is its ability to lay concrete only where it is needed, thereby reducing wastage and CO2 emissions from more cement use.\n\n3D concrete printing also allows builders to design very fine concrete structures. Another advantage of this technology is that builders can cater to individual wishes of customers without raising the cost of construction. For this project, the builders said, the 3D technology helped them blend the houses with the wooden surroundings naturally as if they have always been in this wooded oasis.\n\nThe work on the project began during the 2016 Dutch Design Week, when the Municipality of Eindhoven and TU Eindhoven expressed their intention to build these houses. In 2017, the business community joined in and now the first occupants have moved into the first house.\n\nThe building elements of the first house were printed at Eindhoven University of Technology, but the fifth house, a two-story building, will be printed on site.\n\nA few days ago, India also got its first 3D-printed house in Chennai. The single-storey house is 600 square feet and it was constructed using indigenous concrete 3D printing technology.\n\nThe team that built the house said that they printed the structure using a specialty concrete that they had developed to print large-scale 3D structures. They said the mix was based on ordinary portland cement, which has a lower water-cement ratio. The use of such local materials would also reduce the need to transport concrete long distances, reducing the environmental impact.",

The rest 60 per cent of the staff will be working from their current location.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll move to a hybrid work week where most Googlers spend approximately three days in the office and two days wherever they work best,\u201d Pichai said in the email. \u201cThere will also be roles that may need to be on site more than three days a week due to the nature of the work,\u201d he added.\n\nGoogle will offer four weeks per year where staff can work from anywhere with manager approval. The idea, as per the MountainView, California-based tech giant, is to give everyone \u201cmore flexibility\u201d around summer and holiday travel.\n\nThe global pandemic has changed how we work. While work from home is currently the norm, but as economies begin to begin up, larger organisations such as Google are in favor of a hybrid office model after Covid. However, Facebook and Twitter, are emphasing on work from home \u201cforever\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe future of work is flexibility,\u201d Pichai said. He said the new changes are aimed to help employees do their best at work.

(SpaceX via AP)\n\nSpaceX launched and successfully landed its futuristic Starship on Wednesday, finally nailing a test flight of the rocketship that Elon Musk intends to use to land astronauts on the moon and send people to Mars.\n\nThe previous four tests flights ended in fiery explosions before, during or soon after touchdown at the southeastern tip of Texas, near Brownsville.\n\nThis latest upgraded version of SpaceX\u2019s full-scale, stainless steel, bullet-shaped rocketship soared more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) over the Gulf of Mexico before flipping and descending horizontally, and then going vertical again just in time for touchdown.\n\n\n\n\u201cStarbase Flight Control has confirmed, as you can see on the live video, we are down. The Starship has landed!\u201d announced launch commentator John Insprucker.\n\nA fire at the base of the 160-foot (50-meter) rocket quickly was extinguished, and the rocket remained standing after the six-minute flight. Musk tweeted the landing was \u201cnominal\u201d _ by the book, in other words.\n\nSuccess came on the 60th anniversary of the flight of first American in space, Alan Shepard. And it capped a stunning two weeks of achievements for SpaceX: the launch of four more astronauts to the space station for NASA, the nation\u2019s first nighttime crew splashdown since the Apollo moonshots, and a pair of launches for its mini internet satellites.\n\nIn this image from video made available by SpaceX, a Starship test vehicle sits on the ground after returning from a flight test in Boca Chica, Texas on Wednesday, May 5, 2021.

(SpaceX via AP)\n\nLess than a month ago, NASA chose SpaceX\u2019s Starship to deliver astronauts to the lunar surface in the next few years. The $3 billion contract was halted last week, however, after the losing companies _ Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Dynetics _ protested the selection.\n\nMusk said last month that the NASA money will help development of Starship, which is meant to eventually launch atop a Super Heavy booster. He said it\u2019s been a \u201cpretty expensive\u201d project so far and mostly funded internally. The first high-altitude test was in December.\n\n\u201cAs you can tell, if you\u2019ve been watching the videos, we\u2019ve blown up a few of them. So excitement guaranteed, one way or another,\u201d Musk told reporters after the private company\u2019s second crew flight on April 23.\n\nLong after Wednesday\u2019s touchdown, Starship was still standing tall.",

We will be back in service tomorrow at 9:00 AM ET,\u201d the description for the new Stranger Things HNL Control Room YouTube video reads. Given the video was published Wednesday, it suggests that we should expect something on Thursday, May 6 at 6:30pm IST / 2pm BST / 6am PT. With Stranger Things season 4 back in production since September last year, a new trailer could definitely be on the cards.\n\nWe have already had the one teaser, all the way back in February last year before COVID-19 ripped through the world and brought a halt to Stranger Things season 4 filming in mid-March. Production then resumed in late September and the series' stars were spotted in several locations across October and until late January. At the end of March, actor Gaten Matarazzo said that filming was far from over. Co-star Finn Wolfhard had previously said that season 4 wouldn't be out before 2022.\n\nIn that interview, Wolfhard also teased what to expect from Stranger Things season 4: \u201cEvery season it gets darker. With season 3 I was like, \u2018This is the darkest season that there'll ever be, like the exploding rats and everything.' But really, season 4 so far, it's the darkest season there's ever been. Every year, it gets amped up. Every year it gets funnier and darker and sadder, and everything.\u201d\n\nStranger Things executive producer Shawn Levy noted that the COVID-19 delays allowed the creators, the Duffer brothers, to finish writing all episodes before they began filming: \u201cThe pandemic definitely massively delayed shooting and therefore the launch of our current season 4. But it impacted very positively by allowing the Duffer brothers, for the first time ever, to write the entire season before we shoot it and to have time to rewrite in a way that they rarely had before so the quality of these screenplays are exceptional, maybe better than ever.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Matarazzo and Wolfhard, Stranger Things season 4 also stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Kerry, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Cara Buono, Brett Gelman, Jamie Campbell Bower, Eduardo Franco, Joseph Quinn, and Matthew Modine.\n\nStranger Things season 4 is expected in 2022.

The promo image is available in Spanish language, indicating that the new phone might arrive first in Spain. Also, the design appearing on the image looks quite similar to the regular Redmi Note 10 Pro variant. There could be a new hardware internally, though.\n\nThe tipster said that Redmi Note 10 Pro 5G could come with Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G SoC. The promo image also has Qualcomm's branding. However, Xiaomi has not yet provided any specific details through its official social media channels.\n\nGadgets 360 was not able to independently verify the reported details about Redmi Note 10 Pro 5G.\n\nXiaomi has been rumoured to launch the Redmi Note 10 Pro in a 5G model for some time.

Xiaomi also announced a 5G variant of Redmi Note 10 in the US and European markets in March that starts at $199 (roughly Rs. 14,700) for the 6GB + 64GB storage variant.\n\nIn India, the 4G variant of Redmi Note 10 Pro starts at Rs. 15,999. The phone includes features such as a 6.67-inch full-HD+ (1,080x2,400 pixels) Super AMOLED display and a quad rear camera setup with a 64-megapixel primary sensor. It also has an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G SoC and includes up to 8GB RAM as well as up to 128GB of onboard storage.\n\nDetails about the arrival of the Redmi Note 10 Pro 5G are yet to be revealed by Xiaomi. However, the Chinese company is launching the Redmi Note 10S in India on May 13 as its newest model in the Redmi Note 10 series. That model is already available in some global markets and is not likely to come to the Indian market with 5G support.",

    "Text": "Facebook's oversight board on Wednesday upheld the company's suspension of former US President Donald Trump but said the company was wrong to make the suspension indefinite and gave it six months to determine a \"proportionate response.\"\n\nTrump called the decision and his banning across tech platforms \"a total disgrace\" and said the companies would \"pay a political price.\"\n\nThe much-awaited board verdict has been watched for signals on how the world's largest social media company will treat rule-breaking political leaders in the future, a key area of controversy for online platforms.\n\nThe board, created by Facebook to rule on a small slice of its content decisions, said the company was right to ban Trump following the January 6 storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters.\n\nFacebook indefinitely blocked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the January 6 riot. It enacted the suspension after removing two of Trump's posts during the Capitol riot, including a video in which he said supporters should go home but reiterated his false claim of widespread voter fraud, saying \"I know your pain. I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us.\"\n\nBut the board said Facebook should not have imposed an indeterminate suspension without clear standards and said the company should determine a response consistent with rules applied to other users. It said Facebook could determine that Trump's account could be restored, suspended temporarily or permanently banned.\n\n\"Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international or American smell test for clarity, consistency, and transparency,\" said former federal Judge Michael McConnell, co-chair of the Oversight Board, during a press conference after publishing its decision on Wednesday.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, board co-chair and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said public figures should not be allowed to incite violence or create harm though their posts, but that Facebook \"can't just invent new sanctions as they go along.\"\n\nIn its decision, the board said Facebook refused to answer some of the 46 questions it posed, including those on how its news feed affected the visibility of Trump's posts, and whether the company planned to look into how its technology amplified content as it had done in the events leading to the Capitol siege.\n\nThe board said Facebook's existing policies, such as deciding when material is too newsworthy to remove, need to be more clearly communicated to users. It also called on Facebook to develop a policy that governs how it handles novel situations where its existing rules would be insufficient to prevent imminent harm. See takeaways from the board's decision.\n\nFacebook's business has thrived during the controversy and its main source of revenue, advertising, has boomed as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions begin to ease in the United States, but lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised concerns about the power of Facebook and other social media, many calling for new regulations and some calling for breakups of big tech.\n\nTrump called the move \"an embarrassment to our Country,\" and added that \"Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before.\"\n\nAt a Financial Times conference after the verdict, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communication, said the company would hope to resolve the matter \"considerably faster\" than six months.\n\nTech platforms have grappled in recent years with how to police world leaders and politicians that violate their guidelines. Facebook has come under fire both from those who think it should abandon its hands-off approach to political speech and those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship.\n\nFacebook was one of a slew of social media sites that barred the former president, including Twitter, which banned him permanently, a move welcomed by some civil rights groups and social media researchers. Political leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to US Senator Bernie Sanders expressed concern that private companies could silence elected officials on their sites.\n\nAt the time of the suspension, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said \"the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\" The company later referred the case to its recently established board, which includes academics, lawyers and rights activists.\n\nThe binding verdict means Trump will not for now be able to return to Facebook's platforms, where he had a combined 59 million followers across Facebook and Instagram. His campaign spent about $160 million (roughly Rs. 1,180 crores) on Facebook ads in 2020, according to Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive's campaign tracker.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump launched a web page to share messages that readers can then re-post to their Facebook or Twitter accounts. A senior adviser has said Trump also plans to launch his own social media platform.\n\nWednesday's decision marks a milestone for the oversight board, which Facebook financed with $130 million (roughly Rs. 960 crores). The body has been hailed as a novel experiment by some researchers but criticised by those who have been skeptical about its independence or view it as a PR stunt to deflect attention from the company's more systemic problems.\n\n\"This verdict is a desperate attempt to have it both ways, upholding the 'ban' of Donald Trump without actually banning him, while punting any real decisions back to Facebook,\" said a group of academics, experts and Facebook critics known as the \"Real Facebook Oversight Board.\"\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2021\n\n",

    "Text": "Morphing Matter Lab/Carnegie Mellon University\n\nMaybe food can be fun.\n\nA paper published by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University revealed a new variety of pasta that starts out flat, but -- incredibly -- transforms into unique, 3D shapes after being boiled for seven minutes. But beyond the shape gimmick, the pasta is unique in other ways: it requires less packaging, creates a smaller carbon footprint, and cooks faster than regular dried pasta.\n\nHow does it work? Well, machines press tiny grooves into flat pasta dough made of semolina flour and water. Those grooves form patterns that react with the hot cooking water and turn the flat noodles into waves, tubes, spirals and other shapes. But since it's flat when boxed up, it doesn't need as much packaging and storage space as already 3D noodles would require. That could make it useful in a number of places where space is at a premium, including disaster sites, or even astronauts in space stations.\n\nMorphing Matter Lab/Carnegie Mellon University\n\nAnd as for the inspiration for this sci-fi food? You might have to thank furniture makers such as IKEA.\n\n\"We were inspired by flat-packed furniture and how it saved space, made storage easier and reduced the carbon footprint associated with transportation,\" said researcher Lining Yao.",

    "Text": "Universal Pictures\n\nThe internet is serving up a new way to let you know you're past your prime. You might have noticed the word \"cheugy\" popping up online and wondered what it means and how to pronounce it. New slang is a surefire way to make you question your fleeting youth. In this case, that couldn't be more true. In short, cheugy is a trendy way to say something is passe, and the word's having a moment on TikTok, where folks are busy labeling what's cheugy, having existential crises over being cheugy or just embracing life as a cheug.\n\nRegardless of your cheug status, here's what you need to know.\n\nSo, what does cheugy mean?\n\nCheugy means something that's off-trend. If you look up examples of what's cheugy, though, you'll notice people aren't talking about big hair from the '80s or madras shirts from the '60s. Cheugy seems to be particularly pegged to millennial fashion, style and more. If you're familiar with the word \"basic,\" it's not far off from that. Gird your Pumpkin Spice lattes.\n\nWhat qualifies as cheugy?\n\nThere's no hard and fast rule about what makes something cheugy. If you watch enough TikToks explaining what cheugy is, or check out the Instagram account @CheugLife, you'll run into examples that will start to form a certain picture: the chevron pattern, anything that says \"girl boss\" on it, graphic T-shirts, Ugg boots, being a little too into Disney as an adult. If you've ever bought a wooden sign from Target that says \"Gather,\" that's cheugy. If you have merch from The Office, Harry Potter or Star Wars, that's also cheugy.\n\nWhere did the word cheugy come from?\n\nAt the end of March, TikTok user Hallie Cain posted a video explaining that her friends had a word they used for things that were no longer trendy. According to The New York Times, the word was created by one of Cain's friends, Gaby Rassan, who coined it in 2013 when she was in high school and trying to figure out a term for people who were just a bit off-trend.\n\n\"There was a missing word that was on the edge of my tongue and nothing to describe it and 'cheugy' came to me. How it sounded fit the meaning,\" Rassan told The New York Times.\n\nCheugy's actually had an entry on Urban Dictionary since 2018: \"The opposite of trendy. Stylish in middle school and high school but no longer in style. Used when someone still follows these out of date trends. This may include but not be limited to fashion, habits on social media, usage of slang, etc.\"\n\nOn TikTok, though, the word is gaining traction, with a million and a half views so far for videos tagged with #cheugy.\n\nWait, is this sexist?\n\nIt's a good question. A lot of the examples you run into, whether the aforementioned girl boss energy, Ugg boots or a tank top that says \"ros\u00e9 all day,\" can feel gendered, like they're taking a particular swipe at millennial women. One TikToker, @rod, who creates a lot of content based on being a millennial, did a video specifically focusing on all cheugy stuff you might associate more with men, like golf polos, Axe body spray and cargo shorts.\n\nIn a piece on cheugy, Rolling Stone made the argument that bullying is what happens when you \"weaponize markers of someone's identity against them\" and that poking fun at someone for posting Minion memes doesn't quite meet that standard.\n\nHow do you pronounce cheugy?\n\nIt sounds like chew-ghee. In noun form (a cheug), it sounds like choog.\n\nAre you cheugy?\n\nI mean, if you have to ask...",

Driving the show are complex female characters, two of whom are portrayed by Laura Donnelly and Ann Skelly. Donnelly plays Amalia True, a mysterious, quick-fisted widow, and Skelly is Penance, a brilliant young inventor. Both were \"touched\" during a mysterious event in Victorian England that left them, and others, with abilities.\n\nDonnelly and Skelly were both guests on CNET's I'm So Obsessed podcast. They discussed how the large scale of the world within The Nevers allows the show to deal with both \"Victorian things\" and issues that we experience in 2021.\n\n\"This story very much resonates with society as we know it today,\" said Donnelly. \"Many of the issues we're grappling with at the moment have to do with equality and power. What happens to people who don't have power and suddenly get it? How does the established power of society deal with that?\"\n\nThe Nevers was conceived, written and filmed in part by Joss Whedon who is best known for the shows Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel and Firefly. Some actors and co-workers who worked with Whedon over the past two decades have alleged on-set abuse. In 2020, after filming wrapped, Whedon left The Nevers and was replaced by Philippa Goslett. Many cast and crew members on the show said that they had a positive experience working with Whedon before he left.\n\n\"My experience with Joss was great,\" said Donnelly. \"He was a very supportive, collaborative director.\"\n\n\"We all had a brilliant work relationship,\" said Skelly. \"And the whole set functioned in a very cohesive way.\"\n\nBefore The Nevers, Donnelly was best known for her role as Jenny Fraser on the series Outlander. She has a notable career on stage earning a Best Actress Olivier Award in 2018 for her performance as Caitlin Carney in the play The Ferryman.\n\nSkelly has been in a handful of films and TV shows and in 2018 was nominated for a Best Actress Irish Film and Television award for her performance in the film Kissing Candice.\n\nKeith Bernstein/HBO\n\nYou can listen to my entire conversation with Donnelly and Skelly in the player above or on Apple Podcasts. Donnelly discusses fighting in a Victorian corset, Skelly shares drawing inspiration from Albert Einstein and both explain how they instantly became friends.\n\nWhen I asked if either had anything more to say, Skelly stated exasperatedly, \"I'm not dating Brad Pitt. I just want those rumors to end.\"\n\nAfter a beat, Donnelly, Skelly and I shared a laugh.\n\nYou can watch The Nevers on HBO Max with new episodes airing Sunday nights. You can subscribe to I'm So Obsessed on your favorite podcast app. In each episode, Connie Guglielmo and I catch up with an artist, actor or creator to learn about their work, career and current obsessions.",

    "Text": "Game of Thrones fans finally have some photos from upcoming prequel House of the Dragon to pore over. The HBO show is based on Game of Thrones' author George R.R. Martin's enormous book Fire & Blood, which delves into the violent and fascinating history of the Targaryen family, hundreds of years before Daenerys came along. Yes, this is the family with the whitish-blond hair, fierce dragon-riding skills and penchant for marrying their own relatives.\n\nOllie Upton/HBO\n\nIn a statement, HBO says production on the show has just started and it will be available to stream on HBO Max in 2022. HBO shared a not-very-revealing photo in April, showing various members of the production team seated at computers. But these images are much better, showing actors in full costume and makeup.\n\nEmma D'Arcy, shown above, plays Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, a dragon rider and the firstborn of the king. But as in many royal families, the only problem is she wasn't born male.\n\nMatt Smith, known to many as the eleventh Doctor in Doctor Who, and Prince Philip the Duke of Edinburgh in The Crown, plays Prince Daemon Targaryen, the younger brother to King Viserys and heir to the throne, a peerless warrior and a dragon rider.\n\nOllie Upton/HBO\n\nSteve Toussaint plays Lord Corlys Velaryon, aka a nautical adventurer known as The Sea Snake. He's the lord of House Velaryon, which claims the largest navy in the world and is even richer than the Lannisters (remember them?).\n\nOllie Upton/HBO\n\nOlivia Cooke plays Alicent Hightower, daughter of Otto Hightower, the hand of the king, and \"the most comely woman in the Seven Kingdoms.\"\n\nWelsh actor Rhys Ifans plays Otto Hightower, a loyal and faithful servant to both his king and his realm. But he believes the greatest threat to the realm is the king's brother, Daemon, and his position as heir to the throne.\n\nHBO\n\nAnd with the show's focus on a family of dragon riders, you bet there will be dragons. HBO released looks at the concept art of the dragons back in December. In 2019, Sven Martin, one of the designers of the Game of Thrones dragons, told CNET the fantastical creatures are actually based in part on real animals and how they move.",

    "Text": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nIf you haven't received one of the 163 million stimulus payments the IRS has sent so far, know that the agency will be sending payments to those who qualify till the end of the year. However, if you think something is wrong and your $1,400 payment is lost, it may be time to take action and track down your missing money -- and that's for any of the first, second and third rounds of stimulus payments.\n\nIf you're eligible for any of the stimulus checks but they never arrived, there may be a problem with the payment -- especially if the IRS doesn't have your correct information on file (like an address if you moved). You may also be owed a \"plus-up\" payment if you received some but not all of your $1,400 payment -- you should automatically receive it without having to amend your tax form. (You might also be able to take advantage of a number of other savings opportunities thanks to the latest stimulus law.)\n\nWe'll show you some ways to track your payment, either through a Recovery Rebate Credit (even if you don't usually file taxes) or an IRS payment trace. Plus, here's what we're hearing about a potential fourth stimulus check, what may happen with student loan forgiveness, how to get a $50 discount on your internet bill and the latest on the child tax credit. (Calculate your total here.) This story has been updated.\n\nWhen you should be concerned about a missing stimulus payment\n\nThird stimulus checks are still being sent, so we'd suggest holding out a little longer. If you didn't get your first or second check at all, though, it's time to act. In general, this chart shows when you can and should request an IRS payment trace, which is designed to hunt down a stimulus check the agency says it sent. More below on exactly how a payment trace works, how to get started and when to use it.\n\nWhen to request an IRS payment trace Method of payment Time passed since IRS says it sent your payment Direct deposit 5 days Check mailed to standard address 4 weeks Check mailed to a forwarded address 6 weeks Check mailed to a foreign address 9 weeks\n\nThis timeline was the same for the first and second checks as well. If your first or second stimulus check is missing, you can no longer use the Get My Payment tool to track it down. Here's how to find the amount of your first two stimulus checks.\n\nIf the IRS tracker app says your stimulus check was sent, but you never got it, what can you do?\n\nThe IRS continues to send out the third stimulus check to millions of people, so there's a good chance that if you haven't gotten yours yet, it's in the works. You can check the status of your third check. You need to plug in your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, date of birth, street address and ZIP or postal code.\n\nThe portal will show your payment status, if your money has been scheduled to send and the payment method (direct deposit or by mail) and date. You might also see a different message or an error. (Here's how to track your mailed check through the USPS.)\n\nYou'll need to request a payment trace if the Get My Payment portal shows your payment was issued but you haven't received it within the time frame outlined in the chart above.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Stimulus plus-up payments: What you need to know\n\nYou got a letter from the IRS confirming your stimulus payment, but never got any money. What should you do?\n\nAbout 15 days after the IRS sends your third stimulus check (by either direct deposit, paper check or EIP card), you should get a letter from the agency confirming your payment. The IRS is now sending these letters for the third payment.\n\nIf you received this letter -- also called Notice 1444, Your Economic Impact Payment -- but you never got your payment, you'll need to request a payment trace. Make sure you keep the letter: You'll need the information to file your claim. (Here's what to do if you lost the IRS letter about your stimulus check.) The same is true for the first and second stimulus checks as well.\n\nHow to request an IRS payment trace and claim any of your missing stimulus payments\n\n\n\nTo request a payment trace, call the IRS at 800-919-9835 or mail or fax a completed Form 3911, Taxpayer Statement Regarding Refund (PDF). Note: If you call the number, you'll have to listen through the recorded content before you can connect with an agent.\n\nTo complete Form 3911 for your third stimulus check, the IRS provides the following instructions:\n\n1. Write \"EIP3\" on the top of the form (EIP stands for Economic Impact Payment.)\n\n2. Complete the form answering all refund questions as they relate to your payment.\n\n3. When completing item 7 under Section 1:\n\nCheck the box for \"Individual\" as the Type of return .\n\n. Enter \"2021\" as the Tax Period .\n\n. Do not write anything for the Date Filed .\n\n. Sign the form. If you're married and filing together, both spouses must sign the form.\n\nYou should not mail Form 3911 if you've already requested a trace by phone. And the IRS said you should not request a payment trace to determine if you were eligible to get a check or to confirm the amount you should have received.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Stimulus check 3: How much money you'll get\n\nHow does the IRS process your payment trace?\n\nThe IRS will do the following to process your claim, according to its website:\n\nIf you didn't cash the check, the IRS will issue a replacement. If you discover the original check among your belongings, you're expected to return it as soon as possible.\n\nIf you did cash the refund check, expect a claim package from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which will include a copy of the cashed check. Follow the included instructions. The bureau will review your claim and the signature on the canceled check before deciding whether it will issue a replacement. This is presumably to guard against stimulus check fraud\n\nHow long will it take for your stimulus check to arrive after filing a payment trace?\n\nYou should get a response from the IRS about six weeks after the agency receives your request for a payment trace, according to its website. But this could be delayed due to limited staffing. We've asked the IRS for more information.\n\nFor more on stimulus checks, here's what we know about a potential fourth stimulus check and what else is in the stimulus package that may help you financially.",

    "Text": "Angela Lang/CNET\n\nThe IRS has sent out 164 million third stimulus checks total, with more than 1.1 million more sent this week. After it sends the checks, the agency mails a letter signed by President Joe Biden confirming your payment. But if you still didn't get your check -- or you think the amount is wrong (check with our stimulus calculator) -- keep the IRS notice to claim what you're supposed to get under the American Rescue Plan Act.\n\nIf the IRS based your total on your 2019 taxes but you made less money in 2020, you may be owed more than you actually got. You may have also gained a dependent, like a new baby, that the IRS didn't use to calculate your amount. And if you moved recently, make sure you let the USPS and IRS know so the document arrives at your correct address.\n\nIf you're part of the millions of people who didn't get a first or second stimulus payment you were eligible for, you'll need to claim it as a Recovery Rebate Credit when you file your 2020 tax return -- which is due May 17. (You can use our first stimulus check calculator and second payment calculator to help find your estimated total.) If you never received the IRS letter or you misplaced it, we can tell you how to get a copy so you can claim your missing stimulus money from the third check so you can trigger an IRS payment trace. By the way, here's what to know about a fourth stimulus check and how to get a $50 discount on your internet bill.\n\nWhat the IRS letter (Notice 1444) is for, and why you should hold on to it\n\nThe IRS is now sending out a letter following your third stimulus check, confirming your payment. Officially called Notice 1444-C, the letter signed by Biden shows you the amount you were paid and how you were paid -- by mail or direct deposit. The letter also advises you to check the Get My Payment tool or call a phone number at the bottom of the letter if you've not received your check.\n\nWith the two first stimulus payments, the IRS also sent a confirmation letter in the mail within 15 days of your payment going out -- Notices 1444-A and 1444-B.\n\nIf you believe you received the wrong amount -- such as a dependent was skipped -- or the total doesn't match the estimated amount from our stimulus calculator, it could indicate that you may need to hunt down your missing money using this letter. The IRS advises you to hold on to the letter for your 2021 tax records.\n\nWhat this really means is that it's useful if you need to claim missing money in the future, as you can now on your 2020 taxes as a recovery rebate credit for the first two checks.\n\nHere's more information on using the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet to figure out the credit from the first two checks that you can claim on your 2020 taxes. You'll essentially enter the total amount you determine you're owed on line 30 of the 2020 1040 or 1040-SR tax forms.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Stimulus check 3: How much money you'll get\n\nWhat if your address has changed recently?\n\nThe IRS would have mailed a notice to your last known address with your information on the payment. You'll need to inform the IRS and USPS if you've moved. The IRS needs to independently have your correct information on file.\n\nWhere you can find the IRS details if you can't find the physical letter\n\nIf you don't have the IRS confirmation notice, you should be able to find the information in your federal tax account, using the IRS website.\n\nIf you don't have an account set up with the IRS, head to the IRS account page and tap the blue button that says Create or view your account to get started.\n\nYou'll need to have some information on hand to set up your account, including tax and financial information, plus an email address and a mobile phone number to receive activation codes.\n\nThe IRS said for married couples who are filing jointly, each spouse will need to log in to their own account.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nWhat to do if you can't complete the IRS registration at this time\n\nThe online registration process can take about 15 minutes. During the setup process, the IRS will first email and then text two activation codes. If the codes don't come through, the agency will mail you a letter with an activation code, which can take five to 10 days to get to you. If you want to track the letter, you can use this free service from the USPS.\n\nOnce you've set up your online account with the IRS, you can check your account for the information contained in the notice. If your stimulus payment information is not available when you check, the IRS said it should be in the coming weeks.\n\nHere's more information on tax season and your stimulus check, everything you need to know about the third stimulus check and what could happen with a fourth stimulus check.

    "Text": "Andrew Hoyle/CNET\n\nIn February, Xbox introduced a new feature for the Xbox Series S and Series X called FPS Boost. It allows certain backward-compatible Xbox One games, which originally ran at 30 frames per second, to now run at 60fps or higher on the newer consoles. These enhancements are done in-house by the Xbox hardware group and don't require developer input.\n\nThis week, Microsoft announced that 74 new games would now support FPS Boost, including Far Cry 5, Assassin's Creed Unity, Recore and Alien Isolation. The tally so far is 97 games across the Series X and Series S with the FPS Boost treatment.\n\nThe ability to play these older titles at frame rates some of these games were never meant to run at dramatically increases the value of the Xbox Series S. So much so that I might actually start recommending it over the Series X.\n\nFrame rate is everything\n\nThat's right. Frame rate means everything to me. I've had both the Xbox Series S and Series X since they launched in November, and in that time I've become a complete frame rate snob. For me, frame rate is the most important attribute when it comes to judging how \"next gen\" a game looks.\n\nAnd if a game doesn't at least offer a 60fps mode, I will likely not play it. Sounds harsh, I know, but it's true. Games that run at 60fps look smoother, are more aesthetically pleasing and respond more quickly than lower frame-rate games. Once you've experienced it in more than a handful of games, it's hard to go back to 30fps.\n\nAll of this is why I had a difficult time recommending the Xbox Series S to friends looking for a next-generation system when I first bought it back in November. Aside from the faster load times, most backwards-compatible games ran no better than they did originally. There were a few games that were optimized for the Series S, like Gears 5, that looked great and ran at 60fps. But there weren't nearly enough of these.\n\nThat's all changed now, thanks to the huge influx of both FPS Boost games and also the release of more and more Series S optimized games.\n\nMicrosoft\n\n'Optimized for Series X|S'\n\nWhat if a game doesn't use FPS Boost? That's where the optimizations for Series X and S come in. These essentially take a game that's available on the Xbox One and adds new features like a higher resolution, more graphical effects and of course a 60fps (and or higher) frame rate. These optimizations are typically handled by the developers themselves.\n\nI hate to admit it, but I will buy games I have only a passing interest in if I see that they have the \"X|S\" optimized logo. I did that with Mortal Shell and The Avengers. Also, recently Xbox announced that Sea of Solitude had received the FPS Boost treatment. I'd never even heard of that game before I'd heard about the update, but I downloaded it via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate the day of the FPS Boost announcement. I will at least now give it a try.\n\nSome frustrations still\n\nAs much as I appreciate the improvements made over the last few months, there are still some frustrations. Sometimes games get a 60fps patch on the Series X, but not on the Series S. The Outer Worlds and Wreckfest both now run at 60fps on the Series X, but still top out at 30fps on the Series S.\n\nThis is likely because of the difference in graphical bandwidth between the 12 teraflop GPU in the Series X and the 4 teraflop one in the Series S. Getting some games to run at a consistent 60fps on the Series S -- without using FPS Boost -- might take more work.\n\nRead more: Xbox Series X: Game Pass is the secret weapon\n\nThe system of choice?\n\nIf you're a hardcore gamer willing to pay $500 (\u00a3450, AU$749) for a console -- if you can find one, that is -- the Series X is for sure the system for you. I don't own a PlayStation 5 and likely won't until the end of the year, so can't speak to its quality, but my colleague Dan Ackerman recommends it -- again, if you can find it.\n\nHowever, if you don't fit the above description, the Series S is a great alternative next-gen system. The consoles are a bit easier to find and the value proposition of the SSD speed, performance in optimized games and FPS Boost games is unmatched. When you combine that with Game Pass for $10 or $15 (\u00a311, AU$16) a month, it's a ridiculous value that will only get better over the next few months as more and better games are released.",

    "Text": "Getty Images\n\nParts of the eastern United States are about to witness a remarkable natural spectacle: trillions of cicadas tunneling out from their underground homes for the first time in 17 years to fill outdoor spaces and share their inescapably loud mating calls.\n\nPeriodical cicadas, as they're known, are different than annual cicadas. They spend almost their whole lives a foot or two underground, living on sap from tree roots. Then, in the spring of their 13th or 17th year, depending on the type, mature cicada nymphs emerge for a brief adult stage, synchronously and in huge numbers. Really huge numbers.\n\nGIF by Leslie Katz/CNET\n\nThe insects climb up the nearest vertical surface, often the tree whose roots sustained them. They shed their exoskeletons and inflate their wings. After a few days resting and waiting for their shells to harden, the mating begins. The frenzy is impossible to miss once hordes of males start emitting their high-pitched mating song. That happens via sound-producing structures called tymbals on either side of their abdomen.\n\n\"They may amass ... in parks, woods, neighborhoods and can seemingly be everywhere,\" Michigan State University entomologist Gary Parsons explained in an MSU question and answer session on the phenomenon. \"When they are this abundant, they fly, land and crawl everywhere, including occasionally landing on humans.\"\n\nHere are answers to some of the main questions about 2021's big cicada emergence.\n\nWhat is Brood X?\n\nThe eastern United States is home to six species of periodical cicadas that emerge in different years. Groups of cicadas that share the same emergence years are known as broods.\n\nThis spring, it'll be time for members of one of the largest broods of 17-year cicadas, called Brood X or the Great Eastern Brood, to crawl out from their subterranean hideouts and show off their black bodies and bold red eyes. Expect to see all three 17-year species: Magicicada septendecim, Magicicada cassini and Magicicada septendecula.\n\nWhich states will be impacted?\n\nParts of 15 states, as well as Washington, DC, will hear the romantic serenades of males in trees, trying to attract females. The states are Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nWalking the dog after sunset. Thought wind was gently rustling leaves, except the noise was coming from my feet. #Cicadas are emerging. @capitalweather\u2019s prediction was spot on. #broodx pic.twitter.com/H29ISpWPkx \u2014 Christina TylerWenks (@MusikFrau) May 3, 2021\n\nWhen will the cicadas emerge?\n\nCicada Safari\n\nThe return of the cicadas typically starts around early- to mid-May (sightings of adult cicadas have already been reported in Georgia, North Carolina, southeast Tennessee and the Washington, DC area) and runs through late June. It is, needless to say, a quite sight. Some people view the mass of insects as a pesky annoyance, but others welcome it as an awe-inspiring wonder of nature. Some in the latter category even regularly travel around the US to cicada emergence areas to experience the sights and sounds and help scientists map the creatures.\n\n\"There's an awesomeness to it because you're surrounded by thousands, maybe millions of these creatures that weren't there the day before,\" says Dan Mozgai, one of those citizen scientists. \"It's like an alien invasion, like being in a movie.\"\n\nA free app created at Cincinnati's Mount St. Joseph University, called Cicada Safari and available for iOS and Android, lets the cicada-curious record periodical-cicada sightings. They can also record sightings at the websites Cicada Mania and iNaturalist, a joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society. Cicada mapping helps scientists verify the periodical insects' life cycles, as well as broods' relationships to one another, to gain a better understanding of biodiversity, biogeography and ecology.\n\nBecause Brood X occurs four years after Brood VI and four years before Brood XIV and because the three broods are adjacent to one another in parts of their geographic ranges, cicada trackers may spot \"stragglers\" from other broods this year.\n\n\"From a biological perspective, four-year stragglers from either of these broods are of interest because they can cause gene flow among these broods,\" the University of Connecticut explains. \"From a practical perspective, four-year stragglers from any of these broods complicate mapping efforts, because populations may be difficult to assign to a brood.\"\n\nStragglers may confuse mapping efforts, but the university stresses that a \"misleading map is worse than no map at all.\"\n\nWhy do so many come out at once?\n\n\n\nIt's thought that by emerging in such huge numbers, enough of them can avoid predators and live on to mate -- basically, strength in numbers.\n\nThe cicadas typically begin to come out when soil temperatures 8 inches (20 centimeters) underground reach 64 degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees Celsius). \"That seems to be the trigger that causes them all to emerge over a few days or weeks in one area,\" Parson says. A warm rain often triggers their emergence.\n\nBecause periodical cicadas are sensitive to climate, patterns of different broods and species reflect climatic shifts, note John Cooley and Chris Simon, professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut.\n\n\"For example, genetic and other data from our work indicate that the 13-year species Magicicada neotredecim, which is found in the upper Mississippi Valley, formed shortly after the last glaciation,\" they write in a piece for The Conversation. \"As the environment warmed, 17-year cicadas in the area emerged successively, generation after generation, after 13 years underground until they were permanently shifted to a 13-year cycle.\"\n\nWhat does the male mating call sound like?\n\nIt varies by species, but it can sound like a high-pitched electric buzz, a chirp or a rattle (hear it below). The calls of a group of males can exceed 90 decibels, about the same level as a motorcycle at 25 feet (about 8 meters) away. The females respond to the males' come-hither calls by clicking their wings, and all the back and forth makes for a distinctive symphony.\n\nHear the 17-year cicadas Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nCan cicadas hurt me?\n\nNope, the insects are harmless. They don't sting, bite or carry diseases, and they typically don't come indoors, though they do gather on outside walls.\n\n\"The only way they could get inside is accidentally flying in through an open door or window, or because they had landed on a person who then carried them inside unnoticed,\" Parsons says.\n\nDuring dense emergences, females can lay enough eggs in branches to damage young trees, but the abundant egg-laying also naturally prunes trees, resulting in more flowers and fruit in the years that follow. The cicadas boast other ecological benefits as well. Periodical cicadas aerate large amounts of soil when they emerge en masse, and when they die, their decaying bodies enrich the ground with nutrients.\n\nCan pest control pros help me?\n\nWhen people call for help during cicada emergence, those in pest control are largely in the position of educating clients about why the pest pros aren't going to show up and spray down their yard with pesticide.\n\n\"We really want people to understand and know that pesticides are not the answer, which sounds really funny coming from a pest control company,\" Frank Meek of pest control company Orkin tells my CNET colleague Erin Carson. \"Pesticides are not the thing to use on this insect. They don't work for it, and it's a waste of product, and it's a danger to the environment just to spray down because you're afraid of the cicadas.\"\n\nHow long will Brood X stick around?\n\nThe mass mating lasts at least three to four weeks. Soon after, the newly hatched nymphs will crawl to the edge of the tree branches where the females laid their eggs, drop to the ground and burrow in for the next 17 years. And so the cycle begins again. Godspeed, Brood X.",

    "Text": "Amazon\n\nAmazon Prime Video is peppered with original gems and co-productions with studios from other countries. All you have to do is use this list to sift through and find the very best of the bunch. If you're a recent (or longtime) Kathryn Hahn admirer following WandaVision, you'll find her starring in a smart and interestingly-titled comedy just below. Elsewhere, head to Australia with Picnic at Hanging Rock or the UK with Good Omens. Great stuff.\n\nRead more: The 20 best movies to watch on Amazon Prime Video | Everything you need to know to sign up to Amazon Prime Video\n\nInvincible For those who aren't a fan of cartoons, Invincible could be your converter, up there with other adult cartoons like BoJack Horseman and Rick and Morty. Based on a comic book from Robert Kirkman, the creator of the Walking Dead, Invincible follows 17-year-old Mark Grayson and his training to become a superhero just like his father, who happens to be the most powerful superhero on the planet. Episodes run long at nearly 50 minutes, connected into one big, blood-spattered story. A subversive series with a huge cast featuring Steven Yeun, Sandra Oh and J.K. Simmons, Invincible will engross you in its smart animated world.\n\nI Love Dick Amazon Going on a Katheryn Hahn binge after WandaVision? Marvel's new favorite witch starred in one season of this 2016 comedy with a memorable title. Her character's name is just as memorable: Chris Kraus, an artist and filmmaker who moves to Texas with her husband. She quickly falls in love with his fellowship sponsor, played by Kevin Bacon. Yes, Kevin Bacon is in this. The dynamic of her marriage shifts as her infatuation challenges everything in smart and provocative and adult ways. Sadly, I Love Dick didn't score a second season, but the first is well worth your time.\n\nInformer Amazon Studios This gripping British series is about, yes, an informer, and the murky territory involved in coercing someone to take on the dangerous gig. Paddy Considine (who now has a gig on the Game of Thrones prequel) stars as DS Gabe Waters, a counterterrorism officer tasked with infiltrating a far-right movement in West Yorkshire. Partnered with an excellent Bel Powley (The Morning Show, The King of Staten Island) as the young and inquisitive DC Holly Morten, he attempts to bring British Pakistani Raza (Nabhaan Rizwan) on board to uncover information about a possible terrorist attack. A provocative thriller that will keep you on your toes.\n\nPicnic at Hanging Rock (2018) Amazon Studios This TV version of Picnic at Hanging Rock isn't quite a masterpiece like the 1975 film adaptation of the classic Australian novel. But it's just as mysterious, unfurling a dreamy yet eerie veil over a fictional disappearance in the isolated Australian bush. When three students and their governess go missing after a picnic at the rock area, hysteria sets into the community and the esteemed Appleyard College, led by Natalie Dormer's formidable headmistress. Dark secrets emerge, keeping you hanging on until the end.\n\nGood Omens Chris Raphael This adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's novel pairs two other UK treasures in David Tennant and Michael Sheen. They play the demon Crowley and the angel Aziraphale respectively in this miniseries that sees Earth on the brink of destruction thanks to a final battle between Heaven and Hell. Decidedly against this, after enjoying their time on the planet, the bickering pair team up and attempt to prevent Armageddon. With a stacked cast, including a cameo from Benedict Cumberbatch as, well, Satan, Good Omens is a worthy adaptation, largely thanks to Tennant and Sheen's double act.\n\nThe Wilds Amazon Amazon's first original young adult offering is an intriguing combination of Lost and the Breakfast Club -- and it works. Crucially, the cast of characters who find themselves stranded on a deserted island are all teenage girls. To them, that makes life even more excruciating. Each has a very different background -- from spoiled rich girl to Native American -- but they have to put aside their differences to survive, learning a thing or two about themselves on the way. Things get even more dark and thrilling when Rachel Griffiths' Gretchen Klein comes into the picture as the head of the secretive Dawn of Eve program.\n\nTales from the Loop Amazon Not just another show about a small town where strange things happen, Tales from the Loop has a lot more underneath the surface. Drawing from a narrative art book by Swedish artist Simon St\u00e5lenhag, the series is stunning to look at, meticulous as can be with symmetrical frames. Light and space are infused with a painterly feel. The interconnected townspeople are similarly nuanced, their stories exploring loneliness, aging, the impact of technology and more through sci-fi ideas.\n\nTruth Seekers Amazon Longtime comedy pair Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) hit the small screen with Truth Seekers, a surprisingly dark comedy with a sinister edge. Frost plays Gus, a paranormal investigator when he's not working for Dave's (Pegg) broadband company taking assignments in creepy houses across the UK. The ghost-a-week format turns into solving a larger conspiracy, with a few guest stars who're clearly having a ball. It won't top Pegg and Frost's list of best projects, but it's good fun, especially around Halloween.\n\nHanna Amazon Prime The premise of Hanna, a Joe Wright action thriller from 2011, is so good Amazon fleshed it out for a TV series. Starring Esme Creed-Miles as the skilled young assassin living in the Romanian wilderness, Hanna the TV show expands the teen's backstory and explains why the CIA's Marissa Wiegler has an obsession with capturing her.\n\nAmazon Studios A comedy-drama set in New York's classical music scene, Mozart in the Jungle is as whimsical as its title suggests. Upcoming oboist Hailey meets eccentric conductor Rodrigo, who's tasked with revitalizing the New York Symphony. Never losing you with jargon, Mozart in the Jungle charmingly reveals an edgier side to the world of strings, playing its own symphony of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.\n\nAmazon Studios The Boys stormed Amazon last year with its ultra-violent tale of antihero vigilantes seeking revenge against the world's most beloved superheroes. But these heroes aren't what they seem: Their corporate overlords cover up their shady personal lives, including sexual harassment and the odd assassination. With social commentary, black comedy and pops of gore, The Boys takes a thrilling and unapologetic step away from the family-friendly genre.\n\nAmazon Studios A sex scandal in the UK Parliament? Starring Hugh Grant and Ben Wishaw? You can thank Russell T. Davies for dramatizing this slice of late-'70s British politics. Jeremy Thorpe, a Liberal member of Parliament, wants to silence unhappy ex-lover Norman before his career ends up in tatters. Watch the murder conspiracy, big trial and media scrutiny through A Very English Scandal's darkly funny lens.\n\nAmazon Studios Transparent's unique story follows the Pfefferman siblings who discover their dad is transitioning into a woman named Maura. Other aspects of the Pfefferman's lives, like a sour marriage and a disappointing child, give this tightly scripted comedy-drama a relatable side. Poignant and ambitious, Transparent is a show to look out for.\n\nAmazon Studios While season 2 of Homecoming didn't quite find its feet, season 1 hit the ground running. Julia Roberts stars in this psychological thriller about an army rehabilitation facility run by questionable owners. Using an effective, mystery-building narrative that covers two timelines, Homecoming is high on tension and paranoia as it reveals what the facility's true purpose is. Fun fact: The series uses the actual scores of movies from Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and more.\n\nAmazon Studios This unique series uses the Rotoscoping animation technique to tell the story of a young woman who, after suffering a near-fatal car accident, discovers she can manipulate time. Intriguing, right? It gets better: Bob Odenkirk plays Alma's dead father, who enlists her help in investigating his murder. Bending both time and space, Undone is surreal and beautifully existential for those looking for deep material.\n\nAmazon Studios While The Tick was sadly canceled after two seasons, the superhero comedy will still give you a hit of fast-paced, colorful action with its tongue firmly in its cheek. Based on the comic book character, The Tick is a bulletproof hero who wears a, yep, blue tick suit. His sidekick? The meek Arthur who wears a ... moth suit. Their nemesis is The Terror, a supervillain in their city's underworld. If you want to sit back and watch pure superhero entertainment, you've found the right show.\n\nAmazon Studios The Man in the High Castle imagines an alternate history where the Axis powers (Rome-Berlin-Tokyo) win World War II. Based on a Philip K. Dick novel, the series follows characters in the '60s who live in a parallel universe, where Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan control the US. But there's impossible newsreel footage surfacing of a world where Germany and Japan lose the war, causing some to rebel. To really hammer home its dystopia credentials, The Man in the High Castle is steered by producer Ridley Scott. Fully realized and with a focused plot, this is gripping TV.\n\nAmazon Studios Amazon rescued The Expanse from the realm of canceled TV, bringing us a fourth season with a fifth to come. Thank goodness it did, because The Expanse is smart sci-fi with realistic characters, high production values and a dash of detective noir. Set in a future where humanity has colonized the Solar System, a conspiracy threatens to start a cold war between the largest powers. A band of antiheroes find themselves at the center. Look forward to more space western themes in the consistently excellent later seasons.\n\nAmazon Studios Con man Marius walks free from jail, only to be hunted by the gangster he once robbed. So he assumes the identity of his cell mate Pete and walks back into the lives of Pete's estranged family, who are none the wiser. Bryan Cranston brings all the gravitas to gangster Vince in this part-drama, party-comedy. The twists and dicey situations will carry you through the addictive episodes as quickly as Pete pulls his cons.\n\nAmazon Studios This long-running police procedural, inspired by Michael Connelly novels, gets everything right for old-fashioned detective drama. We follow Los Angeles police detective Harry Bosch, who's haunted by the death of his mother. While catching serial killers and keeping his family safe, he investigates her murder. Functional and no-nonsense, Bosch provides steady mystery with an equally steady lead.\n\nAmazon Studios A '50s housewife who becomes a standup comic? This brilliant series from Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, is filled with sparkling performances from Rachel Brosnahan and Alex Borstein, with dialogue to match. Set in a vibrant and changing New York, our delightful heroine moonlights as a comedian, while doing her duties as an upper class Jewish American housewife. With impressive visuals, warmth and zingers, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is the full package.\n\nAmazon Studios Not only does this horror anthology series feature Japanese folklore and explorers heading into uncharted territory, but its first chapter stars pre-Chernobyl Jared Harris. He plays the captain of Arctic explorer ships that end up stuck in the ice. On top of the harsh conditions and cabin fever, an unknown presence in the mist stalks the crew. Strung with atmospheric dread, The Terror is thrilling, prestige horror. The Terror is available on Prime Video in Australia and AMC in the US (here's a VPN guide).\n\nAmazon Studios If somehow the Fleabag train passed you by, it's time to let it hit you at its full, incredible force. Phoebe Waller-Bridge writes and stars in the play-turned extraordinary comedy series. A 30-something woman who runs a cafe lives a sex-filled life with a sense of humor that hides the tragedies she hasn't yet come to terms with. Just about word-for-word perfect, with a fourth-wall breaking device, Fleabag frequently does its best to both shock and devastate you, while being ridiculously funny.\n\nAmazon Studios Featuring Carrie Fisher's final TV role, Catastrophe is a rom-com about messy, chaotic people. Londoner Sharon and Bostonian Rob have a one-week stand that results in an unplanned pregnancy and Rob moving to the UK so they can start a family. The tricky part: Sharon and Rob don't know the first thing about each other. Covering age, sex, parenthood, marriage and love in its open book, Catastrophe is a superb rom-com that gives you four seasons to devour.\n\n\n\n",

    "Text": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nAnother batch of third stimulus checks is going out this week from the IRS, with 1.1 million payments for more than $2 billion in the mail and as direct deposit as of Wednesday. That makes 164 million payments since March's American Rescue Plan became law. But the IRS is not done. If you qualify for a payment, know that the agency is keeping to a regular payment schedule, sending out weekly batches of money. And that third check may not be all your get from the IRS.\n\nIn addition to the check up to $,1400, you may be eligible for a \"plus-up\" payment, if the IRS underestimated your your dollar amount by using an older tax return when it calculated your payment. And once you get your payment, keep an eye out for a letter from President Joe Biden with information about your third check. See below for why you want to hold on to this confirmation letter. (You may still be waiting for your tax refund, too. Here's how to check on that using the IRS tracker.) Among the payments the IRS has teed up include checks for nonfilers -- people who don't normally file a tax return -- and for those who receive SSI and SSDI benefits.\n\nHere's what to know about the IRS timeline for payments, including how to report a stimulus check problem and when it's time to file a payment trace. If you have kids, keep an eye out for child tax credit payments for up to $3,600 to start this summer, and how to claim up to $16,000 for child care expenses. Also, here's how to check on the status of your tax refund. In a speech last week, Biden talked about what money you could receive as part of his administration's next two stimulus proposals, beyond the American Rescue Plan, including talk of a fourth check. This story is frequently updated.\n\nPlus-up stimulus payments go out each week alongside the third round of checks\n\n\n\nYou could be due a plus-up payment, depending on which year's tax form the IRS used when it calculated your third payment. The IRS may have calculated the amount of your payment using an older tax form instead of your 2020 filing. If that happened to you, once the IRS receives your 2020 tax return and calculates your third payment again, under the American Rescue Plan, you could be due more money based on information from your current filing -- or on other factors if you don't usually file.\n\nThe IRS said it will automatically send these plus-up stimulus payments if it needs to square up the amount it owes you, but to double-check the math, you may want to confirm how much money you should expect this stimulus round, and then track your payment.\n\nShould you track the status of your stimulus check using the IRS tracker?\n\n\n\nKnowing the status of your payment is an important part of making sure you know where your full payment stands. With the IRS Get My Payment tracker tool, you can get a daily update on the status of your payment. The online app can also alert you with a message if there's a problem with your payment that you may need to address.\n\nIf you expect your payment is coming in the mail, you use a free tool from the USPS to track your mailed stimulus payment.\n\nIRS stimulus payment timeline through December 2021\n\n\n\nMost of the third stimulus check payments have gone out from the IRS and US Department of the Treasury based on what information the IRS has on hand to determine payment amounts. The March stimulus law, however, gives these federal agencies until Dec. 31, 2021, to send out all the third checks. That gives the IRS room to process 2020 tax returns and square up payments for those who are owed plus-up amounts, folks who file a 2020 tax extension and other groups, like those who moved or don't have a fixed address (such as people experiencing homelessness).\n\nIf all or part of your stimulus check doesn't arrive by then, you'll need to claim missing money via a 2021 tax return in April 2022, a year from now. This would be similar to the Recovery Rebate Credit for claiming missing money from the first two checks, which is currently in effect for 2020 taxes.\n\nStimulus check payments made to date\n\nDirect deposit Paper checks EIP Card Direct Express Card Plus-up 1st payment batch -- March 17 90 million ($242 billion) 150,000 ($442 million) Not disclosed Not disclosed Not disclosed 2nd payment batch -- March 24 17 million ($38 billion) 15 million ($34 billion) 5 million ($11 billion) Not disclosed Not disclosed 3rd payment batch, including Social Security -- April 3 2 million ($5 billion) 2 million ($5 billion) Not disclosed Not disclosed Not disclosed 4th payment batch, including first plus-up payment -- April 7 24 million ($33 billion) 1 million ($3 billion) Not disclosed 3.1 million 1 million ($2 million) 5th payment batch, including nonfiler veterans -- April 14 1.2 million ($2 billion) 800,000 ($1.4 billion) Not disclosed Not disclosed 700,000 ($1.2 billion) 6th payment batch -- April 21 900,000 ($1.5 billion) 1.1 million ($1.8 billion) Not disclosed Not disclosed 700,000 ($1.2 billion) 7th payment batch -- April 28 1.1 million ($2.5 billion) 850,000 ($1.8 billion) Not disclosed Not disclosed 730,000 ($1.3 billion) 8th payment batch -- May 5 600,000 ($1.1 billion) 500,000 ($900 million) Not disclosed Not disclosed 570,000 ($1 billion)\n\nKeep that Biden stimulus letter from the IRS\n\n\n\nHold on to that letter the IRS is sending you from Biden that confirms your stimulus payment, including the amount. That IRS letter -- officially called Notice 1444-C -- is your proof the IRS sent a payment in case you don't actually receive it or if you received less than you qualify for and need to claim the missing amount later. Here's more on what to do with that IRS letter.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Stimulus plus-up payments: What you need to know\n\nThe IRS may owe you money from the first and second stimulus checks\n\n\n\nPlus-up payments are going out weekly along with the third round of checks, but they may not be the only money you're due. For money missing from the first two checks, you need to claim that on your 2020 taxes. You have until Tax Day to do that, which in 2021 is May 17. We suggest making sure you also know where to find your adjusted gross income. Tax nonfilers may need to be proactive about claiming a new dependent, too.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Stimulus check 3: How much money you'll get\n\nWhat if you have a problem with your stimulus payment? Start here to see an update on its status\n\n\n\nThe IRS doesn't want you to call if you have any issue with the delivery or amount of your stimulus check. So what to do instead? Our guide walks you through how to report stimulus check problems, including checks that never arrived (try filing a payment trace), direct deposit payments that go to the wrong account and other issues.\n\nDid you get less money than you expected in your check?\n\nThe IRS isn't particularly big on communicating how much money it calculates for your stimulus check. You won't find that figure in the agency's online tracking tool, but you will see it in the confirmation letter you'll receive in the mail. (And here's why you got the payment size you did.)\n\nSo what happens if you use our stimulus check calculator and notice the numbers seem way off, or the IRS letter quotes an amount you didn't receive? Start by triple-checking your qualifications to make sure you're eligible for the total you expect. Remember the IRS is automatically sending plus-up payments and that happens after the agency receives your 2020 tax return. If you had a baby or added a dependent in 2020, you won't need to file an amended tax form to claim the supplement.\n\nThe IRS could open up claims for missing stimulus money before its Dec. 31 deadline to stop sending checks. If not, you might have to wait a year to claim it -- when you file your 2021 taxes in 2022 (even if you're a nonfiler who isn't typically required to file taxes).\n\nWhy your stimulus money may not have arrived\n\nAlso, here's what to know if the IRS sent a letter confirming it sent your stimulus payment, but the money never arrived. Here's more information on problems you might encounter with your stimulus check.\n\nStimulus check delivery start and end dates First direct deposits made March 17 (official) First paper checks sent Week of March 15 First EIP cards sent Week of March 22 First Social Security, SSI, SSDI payment sent Weekend of April 3, most arriving April 7 First plus-up payments Weekend of April 3 VA benefits for veteran nonfilers Week of April 14 IRS deadline to finish sending checks Dec. 31, 2021 (mandated by the bill) Last date to receive a check January 2022 (if mailed checks sent late December) Final claims for missing stimulus money 2021 tax season likely (in 2022)\n\nYour 2020 tax return really does make a big difference in your payment total\n\n\n\nTaxes are due May 17. So how will the IRS figure out how much it owes you? It will calculate your total (you can also do that here) based on the most recent tax filing it's processed at the time it's ready to tabulate the amount of your stimulus check.\n\nIf you know your tax return was already processed, your total will likely be based on your 2020 adjusted gross income, not on your 2019 AGI. That presents complications if the difference between the two years disqualifies you from getting a third stimulus check.\n\nOn the flip side, if the IRS uses your 2019 taxes and you're owed more money based on your 2020 AGI and dependents, you could get a plus-up payment. If you got more money than you're owed, you'll only need to return it to the IRS in some cases.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nStimulus check details for Social Security SSI and SSDI recipients and for veterans\n\n\n\nVeterans receiving VA benefits and people who get SSDI and SSI benefits are now receiving stimulus checks from the IRS and Treasury. Delivery details should now be available in the Get My Payment tool.\n\nYou might get your stimulus money by direct deposit to existing Direct Express cards if this is how you normally receive benefits, and if you didn't file taxes in 2019 or 2020. Otherwise, the money could come in the mail (here's what to look for so you know it's legit). The SSA says that Social Security beneficiaries like SSI and SSDI groups will not receive an EIP debit card.\n\nIf you're a tax nonfiler and you used the IRS' Non-Filers tool by November 2020 to submit information, you may have already received your check before other Social Security recipients.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nThere's more: Extra rules and exceptions to know\n\n\n\nStimulus checks aren't necessarily a one-size-fits-all situation. Here are guides for:\n\nAnd here's everything you need to know about the third stimulus check, how to calculate your stimulus total and every way the stimulus law can bring you more money.",

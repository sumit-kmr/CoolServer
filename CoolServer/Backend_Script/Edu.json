You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\n\nHYDERABAD: With the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) cancelling class 10 exams, many city schools are laying more emphasis on entrance tests and pre-board results for class 11 admissions.While entrance exams have been a common practice in many schools, this year it gets added weightage. \u201cWe conducted two rounds of entrance examinations due to Covid-19 this year for class 11 admissions. We have close to 300 class 11 seats for which we had more than 1,500 aspirants who appeared for the entrance exams,\u201d said Lata Shankar, principal, P Obul Reddy Public School, adding that classes for class 11 are set to commence from June first week.While some schools conduct additional rounds of entrance tests, others are giving out provisional admissions either on the basis of objective criterion developed by the CBSE or on the pre-board results. The CBSE has released the evaluation policy and all schools have to form result committee on May 5 and the board would declare class 10 results on June 20.\u201cWe did not find it conducive to conduct an entrance test in the prevailing conditions. Hence, we have decided to consider the pre-board performance of students for class 11 admissions,\u201d said Narasimha Reddy, principal, Hyderabad Public School, Ramanthapur.In CICSE schools as well, the admissions for ISC (class 11) has commenced following the council\u2019s go ahead to do so. \u201cIn addition, schools should prepare a schedule to begin online classes for class 11 students at the earliest.

You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\n\nMUMBAI: Admissions to almost all courses in the state for 2020-21 will remain unaffected after the Supreme Court decision on Maratha reservation on Wednesday. The apex court stated that admissions of Maratha students under the quota before September 9 will remain secured.Many degree colleges had almost completed their admissions by September first week and the state had completed the first round of junior college (FYJC) admissions. After the SC interim order, admissions across courses were stalled for over two months even as the state appealed to the court. The state, in November, decided to apply the interim order and continue admissions without the Maratha quota for 2020-21 academic year. Students from the Maratha community were then asked to apply under the open quota.Of the 3.1 lakh first-year junior college seats in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, 17,844 seats were reserved under the quota and 2,923 students had applied. Of these students, 2,309 were allotted a seat in the first merit list that was announced before the Supreme Court interim stay on the quota on September 9. Their admissions remain safe even after Wednesday\u2019s order.A month later, the state allowed Maratha candidates to avail themselves of the benefit of the 10% Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) quota. Despite allowing Maratha candidates to apply as EWS, the quota had a 68% vacancy across the state when admissions concluded. Next year, the decision will basically mean around 40,000 more FYJC seats will be open for students.Medical aspirants, students and their parents from the open category, who were also one of the petitioners\u2019 group, are relieved after the order. Medical students were the worst affected with the additional quota as their seats shrank by 12%, when they only have a few thousand seats available in the state. Dr Aparna Ranadive, one of the petitioners, said that the fight was not only for this batch, but for all students in future.",

You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\n\nGUWAHATI: The Assam government on Wednesday declared closure of all educational institutions for an indefinite period, irrespective of the severity of the Covid situation in districts. Despite a continuous spike in new Covid cases, physical classes were going on in some Assam districts, where the cumulative number of positive cases recorded in the last 10 days were below 300.To date, the local administrations were declaring closure of educational institutions, including hostels and coaching institutes, as and when the cumulative number of positive cases touched the 300-mark in the respective districts. Superseding all previous orders, the state education department ordered closure of all kinds of educational institutions up to the university level. But the official works of the educational institutions will be guided by the latest directives issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).\u201cFrom today, all educational institutions will remain closed till an indefinite period. Whether a district has touched 300 cases or not, every institution will have to be closed in the backdrop of the direction by the state government to close shops, commercial establishments, etc., from 2 pm everyday starting today,\u201d said education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.An official notification by the state secondary education department on Wednesday stated that the directive will be implemented in both government and private institutions \u2014 starting from pre-primary section to university level \u2014 from Thursday (May 6) until further orders. It, however, instructed the institutions that an online mode of education should be made available for students.All educational institutions, including the coaching institutes and hostels in Guwahati were closed on Tuesday last week, soon after the daily number of positive cases crossed the 1,000-mark in Kamrup (Metropolitan) district. Apart from the academic institutions in the city, those in 23 other districts were also closed by Wednesday, as these districts crossed 300 positive cases in the last 10 days. Barring some districts, mostly comprising rural areas, the educational institutions were already closed in the rest of the districts.Assam Class X and XII state board exams were postponed on Tuesday, until further orders. The exams were scheduled from May 11, however, the boards were in a dilemma on conducting the exams due to closure of the institutions in the districts.\u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t understand age group. In Assam, the elementary students were at home but in higher classes, students were coming out of homes in many districts for classes, risking their lives. It was illogical when the government was appealing to people to stay at home. We are happy that the decision has been taken, though late,\u201d Gobinda Kalita, general secretary of the Asom Madhyamik Sikshak Aru Karmachari Santha, said.",

This is happening despite NU authorities clearly telling colleges to strictly avoid inviting students to campus, to protect them from getting infected by the Covid-19 virus.A popular girls\u2019 college in West Nagpur issued a circular for students from BA, BCom, BSc and postgraduate courses, asking them to collect and fill up exam forms in the college. A copy of the circular sent by the students to TOI clearly states that those in fourth and sixth semesters need to fill up forms and also bring their earlier marksheets.After TOI sent a copy of the circular to vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari and Board of Examinations and Evluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable, the worried students and their parents finally got relief.\u201cWhen I called the principal, it came to fore that the college registrar had issued that circular. He cited the reason that hardcopy of previous semester marksheet has to be collected and attached to the exam forms. But when I told them to avoid calling students to college campuse in view of spike in cases, they withdrew the circular,\u201d Chaudhari told TOI.TOI had on May 1 highlighted how some NU colleges were asking students to appear for offline exams, even as government had directed all varsities to conduct online exams only.Soon after VC\u2019s censure, the college principal issued a notice to all students on WhatsApp, asking them to fill up exam forms in online format only and even make the payment through apps or net banking. It was also clarified that they don\u2019t need to submit marksheets of previous exams.\u201cDue to the ongoing pandemic situation, all senior college, undergraduate and postgraduate students are informed not to visit the college in person for submission of exam forms for Summer-2021. Online payment for exam should be paid on or before May 15. Also note that exam forms of only those students who have done online payment will be filled up and forwarded by college office to the university,\u201d the principal\u2019s message mentioned.The VC added that NU had already sent instructions to all colleges not to invite students to campuses in view of pandemic and also due to restrictions in force. \u201cTheir management didn\u2019t read the instructions carefully.

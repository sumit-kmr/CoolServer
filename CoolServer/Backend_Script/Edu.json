But now I do not even know how to plan my studies as there is no clarity on the exams. Last week, I just took a break because I was tired. Sometimes I am really kicked about studying, at other times, it\u2019s quite demotivating.\u201dAgreed Deepak Ram, a science student at Harvest International School. \u201cAll these days there was a rhythm to the preparation. Now there\u2019s a hiccup in the flow. To keep yourself prepared and motivated for an exam about which there is no clarity is tough.\u201dTeens say the lockdown is only making things tougher for them. \u201cWe cannot even go out to relax. We now resort to combined study online,\u201d said Bhadra.Schools say students are worried about their future academic plans too. Many of them who have applied to foreign universities are finding the wait taxing. \u201cStudents are emotionally drained out. Many schools started class 12 portions in March, some as early as January 2020. It has been 1.5 years and it is dragging on. It\u2019s too risky to hold exams. Children are stuck, some of them have withdrawn. It\u2019s tough to keep them motivated,\u201d said J Bhuvaneswari, principal, Presidency School, Bangalore south.Psychologists and counsellors say they have been getting cases of students reeling under anxiety due to the uncertainty. \u201cStudents need to learn by understanding concepts and not rote learn as they tend to forget faster if answers are just memorised. Have a fixed routine till exams. Spend some time studying and focus on learning some new skills. Parents should be careful not to overstress on revisions as students will be put off by it, considering they have been struggling with it for many months now,\u201d said Sulata Shenoy, director, Turning Point, centre for counselling and psychological assessment.",

Pradhan had requested Joshi in September last year to set up KVs in these areas for the benefit of the children of these districts.In fact, Pradhan had received letters from Sundargarh MP Jual Oram, Dhenkanal MP Mahesh Sahoo, and Bargarh MP Suresh Pujari seeking the establishment of three MCL-sponsored KVs in Sundargarh, Angul, and Jharsuguda districts. The gross enrolment ratio at the primary level of the three districts is below the national average.In his letter to Joshi, the petroleum minister had said MCL\u2019s extensive presence in the mining and industrial belts of Odisha is cherished by the people of the state. \u201cIt would be most apt of MCL to extend its management prowess in undertaking welfare activities for people living around its operational areas. I understand that there is an existing provision for the establishment of KVs funded by central public sector enterprises like MCL,\u201d he had written in the letter.On September 20 last year, he had requested Joshi to establish KVs in the three districts for the benefit of the residents of the operational areas of MCL and the wards of the MCL staff. Before this on April 22, Joshi had sent a letter to Pradhan in the same connection.",

    "Text": "Congratulations! You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\n\nGUWAHATI: The Cotton University \u2014 erstwhile Cotton College \u2014 fraternity was elated after receiving the news of their most popular student union leader from the late 1980s becoming the 15th chief minister of Assam.One of the breeding grounds of future politicians, Cotton College produced six former chief ministers of Assam- Gopinath Bordoloi, Mahendra Mohan Choudhury, Sarat Chandra Singha, Jogendra Nath Hazarika, Hiteswar Saikia, and Bhumidhar Barman- in the post-independence era. Despite the Cotton alumni playing an influential role across the political spectrum of the state all along, a Cottonian could not adorn the chief minister's chair in Assam since 1996. As Himanta Biswa Sarma is set to be sworn in as the new chief minister on Monday, both the alumni and students of the leading higher education institution have pinned high hopes from him, which is far broader than transforming the education scenario of the state.\u201cHe (Himanta) had a great zeal to work for students and society. At his initiative, Cotton College was announced as a Centre of Excellence. It was because of his efforts that Cotton College got transformed into a university. With sheer hard work, he came a long way to become a political stalwart of the northeast and the new CM is our very own CM,\u201d said Jagadish Dutta, general secretary of Cotton Alumni Association. He was hopeful that under Himanta\u2019s leadership, Assam will become one of the top-3 states of the country.Himanta drew severe criticism from the Cottonians, who took the lead in intensifying the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) when the legislation was passed in December 2019. However, many said they trusted Himanta\u2019s faith in Cotton University, despite differences on a range of political issues. Besides being a frontline leader of the All Assam Students\u2019 Union (Aasu), Himanta was a three-time general secretary of Cotton College Union Society (CCUS) in 1988-89, 1989-90, and 1991-1992.Incumbent general secretary of Cotton University Students\u2019 Union, Rahul Bordoloi, said on personal grounds, they never attacked Himanta. He, however, said on socio-political issues such as CAA, Cottonians will continue to remain firm on the stance. \u201cWe feel proud at Himanta Biswa Sarma\u2019s elevation to the chief minister\u2019s post. He is fond of his alma mater and we consider him as our guardian,\u201d said Bordoloi, a border of the Sitanath Brahma Choudhury Hostel of the university, where Himanta spent a significant period of his student life.The general students, who could not come out to the streets to celebrate the occasion, were equally jubilant after the end of the week-long dilemma on the new CM of Assam. \"Dr. Himanta Biswa Sarma, a three-time general secretary of CCUS paved his way from being a popular student leader to 15th chief minister of Assam. How does he address the issue of CAA and also implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord is what we are looking for. As of now, we expect an eligible cabinet under his leadership that plans and works to tackle the pandemic that has affected our state,\" said Rahul Gupta, a postgraduate fourth-semester student of the state university.",

Now, with lockdown being imposed, things have only got more uncertain for those dreaming of an MBBS seat.The government had started free residential training for interested students a few years ago due to fewer government school students from Tamil Nadu clearing NEET. It was shifted to online mode last year due to the pandemic. A private firm was hired for providing NEET coaching on the E-Box platform and online training began in November last year for those slated to appear for the test this year. Presently, there are 486 students undergoing training, but the number was more than 600 including students from government-aided schools.\u201cMany students from the aided schools didn\u2019t show interest as 10.5% horizontal reservation for students from government schools in MBBS admission is not applicable for them,\u201d said officials at Trichy district chief education office. But keeping the existing students focused on training has been challenging for teachers, especially after the schools were closed last month.While schools reopened for students of class XII by January end of this year, they were being prepared for the board examinations. It was also helping the teachers to give necessary instructions in person. But the closure has come as a setback as students could not be monitored, said a government school teacher. \u201cSince all the 486 students are not showing interest in the training, we have narrowed down the focus to 76 students,\u201d said M Joan of Arc, coordinator for free NEET coaching in Trichy.",

Government schools have already announced summer vacation due to the pandemic situation.School heads said while absenteeism was not an issue last year, it has become an issue now students of various age group are either suffering from Covid themselves or are unable to attend classes because of household chores as other family members are struck by the virus.\u201cLast year, the students led a regimented life at home and were less prone to falling ill. Also, the first wave spared children. But not so in the second wave,\u201d said Sujoy Biswas, principal of the Ram Mohan Mission School.Usually, students fall ill around March or September due to a change of season. During monsoon, too, many fall ill. In the past, dengue has also been a problem, particularly among students from southern and northeastern pockets of the city. But this time, students from across the city are facing Covid crisis.Richard Gasper, principal of St Augustine\u2019s Day School, Ripon Street said students were applying for sick leave citing Covid. \u201cAfter receiving requests from parents to excuse them from the online sessions, sick leaves were granted,\u201d Gasper said.Krishna Damani, spokesperson of South Point School, too, said many students and teachers were reporting Covid. \u201cWe had arranged for substitute teachers to hold classes. We were flexible and allowed students to take leave,\u201d he said. But with parents getting infected and sending kids to a separate place for quarantine, the school decided to give families some respite and bring forward summer break.Heritage School principal Seema Sapru has sent a mail to the parents that highlights the challenges the school is facing with many teachers, students and their families contracting the infection.Though most of the afflicted children are being treated at home, the weakness induced by the virus is so much that students are unable to attend online classes. Doctors too recommend complete rest. \u201cStudents must remain hydrated and consume adequate vitamin C and protein,\u201d said a doctor.",

You have successfully cast your vote Login to view result\n\nMUMBAI: With uncertainty looming over the evaluation process for SSC students, the state has now turned to principals and teachers to find out if internal assessment based on online teaching is possible.The board exams were cancelled due to the Covid crisis but an alternative assessment format is yet to be finalised. CBSE and ICSE boards have begun evaluation based on internal tests.State board schools were instructed not to take online exams due to connectivity issues in rural areas. While many private institutions have conducted internal tests, aided schools followed the state directives.Principals of aided schools have communicated to the state the challenges of internal assessment-based rating. Students have to be evaluated for 600 marks (best of five subjects). The state now wants principals, teachers and managements to respond through a survey. Over 17 lakh students were to take SSC exams. A CET for Class 11 admission is also being discussed.Principals underlined the need for a sound methodology so that it can be applied the next academic year too. \u201cLast year, very little assessment was done. Some evaluation was possible in January and February, but evaluating them based on two months will be unfair,\u201d said the principal of a school in Bandra.Students have begun scrambling to submit assignments. About 10-15% are out of the city due to the pandemic. \u201cWe have been told to get these students to submit assignments and projects in case internal evaluation becomes inevitable,\u201d said a teacher from a Goregaon school. The state has also asked schools to give details of evaluation processes.India Wide Parents Association president and child rights activist, advocate Anubha Sahai, said, \u201cNot all schools have a back-up if the state decides to opt for internal assessment. On the other hand, students are not ready for an offline CET.\u201d",

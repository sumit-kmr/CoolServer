This shipment includes a climate-friendly oxygen generation unit which can turn air into oxygen. Thanks to the people of California!\" the US embassy said in a tweet.\n\nSeparately, US Charg\u00e9 D'Affaires in India Daniel B Smith said both the countries will together defeat the pandemic.\n\n\"The #USIndia partnership involves all aspects of the relationship: government, business, and people. This week, vaccine components arrived in India from the U.S. that will enable the manufacturing of 20 million doses of the Covishield vaccine. Together we will defeat Covid-19!\" he said in a tweet.\n\nProviding raw materials for the production of anti-coronavirus vaccines was a major component of the Biden administration's announcement on medical aid to India.\n\nThe Covishield vaccine is produced in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII), based in Maharashtra 's Pune.\n\nLast month, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla appealed to US President Joe Biden to lift the embargo on the export of raw materials needed to manufacture the vaccines.\n\nMinistry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said a shipment of over 81,000 vials of Remdesivir from the US arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Further elevating the India and the United States Strategic Partnership! Appreciate the shipment of over 81000 vials of Remdesivir from the US that arrived early this morning in Mumbai,\" he tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel delivered its first consignment of medical supplies comprising oxygen concentrators to India on Wednesday. The consignment was brought to the country in a special flight.\n\nThe Israeli embassy said more such flights will bring emergency medical aid, including thousands of group and individual oxygen generators, respirators, medications and additional medical equipment.\n\n\"In this hour of need, our two democracies stand solidly side by side. The State of Israel is happy to lend a helping hand to our friend India in this complicated and difficult time,\" Israeli ambassador Ron Malka said.\n\n\"Our friendship is strong and collaboration during the Covid-19 crisis will only make it stronger. I see great importance in the cooperation with India in this joint fight against the global pandemic,\" he added.\n\n",

Medical staff checked their status regularly in the neonatal ward wallpapered with cartoon characters.\n\nMs. Cisse had been expecting seven babies. Malian doctors, under government orders, sent her to Morocco for the births because hospitals in Mali are ill-equipped to provide adequate care for this exceptional multiple pregnancy.\n\nThe Casablanca clinic's director Youssef Alaoui told Moroccan state TV that they had been contacted by Malian doctors about the case a month and a half ago. They were not expecting nine babies, he said.\n\nMs. Cisse gave birth prematurely at 30 weeks and is now in stable condition after heavy bleeding for which she was given a blood transfusion, he said.\n\nThe cesarean was ordered after Ms. Cisse had \u201cbirth pains,\u201dMr. Alaoui, the clinic director, said. The babies weigh between 500 grams and one kilogram.\n\nThe Guinness Book of World Records said in an email to The AP on Wednesday that its current record for most living births at once is eight, and that it is verifying the Morocco birth.\n\nThe current holder of the Guinness record is American Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to eight premature but otherwise healthy children in 2009.\n\nMr. Alaoui, the clinic director, told The AP that as far as he was aware Ms. Cisse had not used fertility treatments. The Malian health ministry did not provide any other information about the pregnancy or births.\n\nYacoub Khalaf, a professor of reproductive medicine at King's College London, said that such births would be extraordinarily unlikely without fertility treatment, and noted the dangers involved with such multiple births.\n\nThe mother \u201cwas at severe risk of losing her uterus or losing her life,\u201d he said. The babies \u201ccould suffer physical and mental handicaps. The risk of cerebral palsy is astronomically higher.\u201d He urged more awareness worldwide about monitoring fertility treatments and about the risks and costs of having so many premature babies at one time.",

The news will support the increased production of vaccines globally as countries, including India, continue to reel under the impact of the pandemic. The initiative was first floated by India and South Africa last October.\n\n\"The administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines,\" United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced, adding that the \"extraordinary circumstances\" called for \"extraordinary measures.\"\n\nMs. Tai also said that the negotiations to effect the IP waiver would take time.\n\n\"We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) needed to make that happen. Those negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved,\" she said.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala held discussions in with ambassadors from developed and developing countries to discuss access to COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, based on an Indian and South African initiative first launched in October 2020.\n\nOver a 100 countries have supported the proposal, according to the Associated Press. U.S. President Joe Biden has also been under growing pressure, domestically, to support a waiver, with 110 Democratic Members of Congress writing to him last week on the issue. Earlier in April, Bernie Sanders and nine Democratic Senators, including Elizabeth Warren, had also written to the President in support of a waiver.\n\nOpposition galore\n\nThere has been opposition to the waiver from some quarters of Capitol Hill. Twelve GOP Members of Congress wrote to Mr. Biden on Tuesday urging him to consider other means to increase vaccine access that did not involve weaking IP protections, which, they argued, were not a manufacturing bottleneck. Weakening protections would hamper American competitiveness and innovation, they said. Some in industry have also opposed the plan.\n\n\"In the midst of a deadly pandemic, the Biden Administration has taken an unprecedented step that will undermine our global response to the pandemic and compromise safety,\" said Stephen Ubl, head of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, according to the Associated Press.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Biden said that the U.S. would produce as many vaccines as possible and export them. At present, three vaccines are approved for use in the U.S. \u2014 from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The U.S. plans to send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine to other countries over May and June.\n\nMs. Tai reiterated the plan to produce more vaccines. \"The Administration's aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,\" she said.\n\n\"As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts \u2013 working with the private sector and all possible partners \u2013 to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. It will also work to increase the raw materials needed to produce those vaccines,\" she said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers applauded the news of the waiver.\n\n\"Let\u2019s do insulin next,\" progressive Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, with a graph indicating that the share prices of some vaccine manufacturers had plunged following the announcement.",

Erebus, one of two ships to sail in Sir John Franklin\u2019s 1845 expedition to find the fabled Northwest Passage, a sea route through the Canadian Arctic that would serve as a trade route to Asia.\n\nDisaster struck. The Erebus and the H.M.S. Terror became stuck in ice in Victoria Strait, off King William Island in what is now the Canadian territory of Nunavut. In April 1848, the survivors \u2014 Franklin and nearly two dozen others had already died \u2014 set out on foot for a trading post on the Canadian mainland.\n\nAll 129 explorers ultimately perished, succumbing to brutal blizzard conditions and subzero temperatures. The doomed expedition endured in the public imagination \u2014 inspiring fiction by Mark Twain and Jules Verne, and, more recently, the 2018 AMC series \u201cThe Terror\u201d \u2014 driven in part by rumors that the crew resorted to cannibalism. The wreckage lay quiet until 2014, when a remotely controlled underwater vehicle picked up the silhouette of the Erebus near King William Island. Two years later, a tip from a local Inuit hunter led to the discovery of the Terror in the ice-cold water of Terror Bay.",

Jaishankar, speaking at a Global Dialogue Series event in London, reiterated India\u2019s view on Wednesday that it is \u201cnot realistic\u201d to have good relations in other domains when there was tension on the border. Mr. Jaishankar did not specifically mention the 5G issue, but said broadly on India\u2019s view on the relationship: \u201cI can\u2019t have friction, coercion, intimidation, and bloodshed on the border, and then say let us have a good relationship in other domains. It is not realistic.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) gave permission to several Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) to conduct 5G trials, and did not include Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. \u201cThe applicant TSPs include Bharti Airtel Ltd., Reliance JioInfocomm Ltd., Vodafone Idea Ltd. and MTNL,\u201d the announcement said, adding they had \u201ctied up with original equipment manufacturers and technology providers which are Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung and C-DOT\u201d while Reliance Jio Infocomm will conduct trials using its own indigenous technology.\n\nReacting to the move, the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement it \u201cexpress[es] concern and regret that Chinese telecommunications companies have not been permitted to conduct 5G trials with Indian Telecom Service Providers in India\u201d.\n\n\u201cRelevant Chinese companies have been operating in India for years, providing mass job opportunities and making contribution to India\u2019s infrastructure construction in telecommunications,\u201d spokesperson Wang Xiaojian said.\n\nHe said moves to \u201cexclude Chinese telecommunications companies from the trials\u201d would \u201charm their legitimate rights and interests\u201d. \u201cThe Chinese side hopes that India could do more to enhance mutual trust and cooperation, and provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory investment and business environment for market entities from all countries, including China, to operate and invest in India.\u201d\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s dialogue, Mr. Jaishankar said the relationship was \u201cgoing through a very difficult phase, because in violation of agreements and understandings of many, many years, the Chinese have deployed a very large part of their military on, and close to, the Line of Actual Control, without explanation, and they continue to be there\u201d.\n\nMr. Jaishankar noted it had been one year since the LAC crisis began, on May 5, 2020 with reports of tensions then starting in the Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake.\n\nHe said China\u2019s \u201cactions have disturbed peace and tranquillity\u201d, including leading to bloodshed in Galwan last June, and India \u201chas been very clear that peace and tranquillity on the border areas is essential for the development of our relations\u201d. The disengagement process was completed in some areas but one year on is still ongoing in others, and both sides had not yet come to the de-escalation part.\n\nOn Friday\u2019s phone call with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the External Affairs Minister said both sides had discussed their mutual interest in cooperating on tackling COVID-19 at a time when Indian companies have placed many orders to source supplies from China amid the current crisis.\n\nHe told Mr. Wang that \u201cmany of our companies are ordering stuff from China and we are encountering difficulties in logistics, so please take a look at it which is something which we would appreciate\u201d.\n\n\u201cAfter our conversation things did move,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of our airlines got quicker approvals, the logistics chain is flowing, and that is something which is very laudable.\u201d",

Cascade shifted about $1.8 billion of shares in Canadian National Railway Co. and AutoNation Inc. this week to French Gates, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.\n\nTheir separation is expected to involve a wealth transfer on a scale that's only been seen in a few other divorces, though few details have yet emerged. It could also have ramifications for one of the most important philanthropic organizations on the planet. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given away in excess of $50 billion to support healthcare, education, gender equality and efforts to combat climate change.\n\nGates, the 65-year-old co-founder of Microsoft Corp. is worth $144.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. French Gates, 56, is a former Microsoft manager who's gained international prominence co-running the foundation, and more recently for starting Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company to advance 'social progress' in the U.S.\n\nBill Gates's biggest asset is Cascade Investment, which he created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. Cascade oversees a vast portfolio comprising real estate, energy and hospitality as well as stakes in dozens of public companies.\n\nThe biggest public position is agricultural-machinery maker Deere & Co., with Cascade holding more than 10% of the stock valued at about $12 billion, followed by an $11.8 billion stake in waste-collection company Republic Services Inc., Bloomberg data show. That's followed by Canadian National and Ecolab Inc.\n\nMost of the portfolio, overseen by money manager Michael Larson, is comprised of North American companies, but it also owns stock in Diageo Plc, the world's largest distiller, and London-based private-jet services firm Signature Aviation Plc.\n\nThe Gateses are also among the largest landowners in America and have homes including their 66,000 square-foot mansion in Medina, Washington.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

All the restrictions, which cover around 5.3 million people in the country\u2019s biggest metropolitan area, take effect at 5 p.m. local time and are scheduled to last until Monday morning.\n\n\u201cWe believe this is a proportionate response to the risk we have ahead of us,\u201d NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.The measures, which also cover Sydney\u2019s neighbouring regions of Wollongong, the Central Coast and Blue Mountains, were spurred by the detection of COVID-19 in a 50-year-old man, who passed the infection to his wife.The case, the first local transmission in NSW in more than a month, baffled health officials given the man had no known links to high-risk jobs or people.\n\nTesting has determined the man was infected with a variant first detected in India and genomic sequencing had linked the case to a returned traveller from the United States, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said on Thursday, but there was no clear transmission path between the two people.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t find any direct link between our case, so what we\u2019re concerned about is there is another person that is as yet unidentified that infected our case,\u201d Chant said.\n\nIt appeared to be the first time officials had reported the local transmission of an India virus variant in Australia.Tests on the infected man had showed a higher viral load than typically seen in infected people, potentially increasing the chance that the man has spread the disease, officials said.NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet entered self-isolation on Thursday after he visited a restaurant at the same time as the infected person, classifying him as a close contact, his office said.\n\nPerrottet, who attended a sitting of state parliament on Wednesday, has tested negative.\n\nAuthorities also asked thousands of residents in the city\u2019s inner west to seek testing for any mild flu symptoms after fragments of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were detected in the sewerage network used by several suburbs.Speedy tracing systems, movement curbs and border restrictions have largely reined in the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, which has recorded 29,865 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nThe federal government is currently under pressure to overturn a temporary travel ban on travellers, including its own citizens, from COVID-ravaged India. Australia has blocked all direct flights from the country until May 15.\n\nA report in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday, citing unidentified sources, said at least two repatriation flights will be dispatched to India every week from the middle of this month to bring home around 9,000 Australians.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison, however, said the situation would be constantly reviewed.\u201dWe are not going to commit to that at this point,\u201d Morrison told radio station 3AW on Thursday.",

Denmark has also withdrawn the shot from use.European and UK medicine regulators have said the vaccine is safe and effective, and that its benefits far outweigh any side effect risks, but several other countries have recommended using it only in certain age groups.\n\nThe BMJ study looked at 280,000 18-65 year-olds in Denmark and Norway who had a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine between the start of February and March 11.\n\nUsing national health records, the researchers identified rates of events such as heart attacks, strokes, deep vein blood clots and bleeding events within 28 days of receiving a first vaccine dose, and compared them with expected rates in the general populations of Denmark and Norway.\n\nResults showed 59 blood clots in the veins, compared with 30 expected, equating to 11 excess events for every 100,000 vaccinations. The researchers said this included a higher-than-expected rate of rare brain blood clots, known as cerebral venous thrombosis, at 2.5 cases per 100,000 vaccinations.\n\nCommenting on the findings, Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at Britain\u2019s University of East Anglia, said they added to understanding of the risk of thrombosis after COVID-19 vaccination, but should not alter regulators\u2019 conclusions.\n\n\u201cThose countries that delayed their own vaccination programmes at a time of high transmission rates by declining to use available (AstraZeneca) vaccines should know that their decision will have contributed to an increase in the number of avoidable deaths from COVID-19,\u201d he said.",

(Reuters)\n\nThe city of Atlanta on Wednesday reinstated a police officer fired over the fatal shooting of a Black man last year after an oversight board ruled that he was terminated without due process.\n\nThe Atlanta Civil Service Board said the city failed to follow its own procedures when Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms dismissed Garrett Rolfe, who is white, without a hearing. He shot Rayshard Brooks, 27, in the back in June outside a Wendy\u2019s restaurant.\n\nRolfe is charged with felony murder, aggravated assault and other crimes in the case. A trial date has not been set.The city said in a statement that he would remain on administrative duty. Representatives for the city and the board were not available for further comment.\n\nThe mayor defended her initial decision to fire Rolfe. \u201cGiven the volatile state of our city and nation last summer, the decision to terminate this officer, after he fatally shot Mr. Brooks in the back, was the right thing to do,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe June 12 shooting, which came two weeks after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, heightened tensions across the United States over police brutality and racism in American policing and led to sometimes violent protests in Atlanta and other cities.\n\nPolice officers were responding to complaints that Brooks had fallen asleep while drunk behind the wheel of a car in the drive-through lane of the fast-food restaurant. After a struggle, he wrested away one officer\u2019s Taser, fired it at police and then ran away, defying their orders to stop. He was shot twice in the back.\n\nThe Civil Service Board ruled that Rolfe was not offered the opportunity to respond to the allegations that led to his dismissal.\n\nHis lawyer, Lance LoRusso, said in a statement that Rolfe was innocent and \u201chas now won the opportunity to explain what happened.\u201dGerald Griggs, vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP, the largest U.S. civil rights organization, said under no circumstances should Rolfe go back on street patrol.\n\n\u201cHe does not deserve a to be a police officer in this or any city, and we are going to protest,\u201d Griggs said. \u201cThe community is upset and this will not stand.\u201d\n\nMore than two dozen protesters gathered on the steps of Atlanta City Hall on Wednesday evening, with many of them holding signs with slogans such as \u201cStop Police Killing\u201d \u201cJustice for Rayshard Brooks\u201d and \u201cJail Killer Cops Now.\u201d\n\nSome protesters called for the city to fire Rolfe again.\u201dRayshard Brooks needed a ride home, what he wound up with was a bullet in his back,\u201d said Devin Barrington-Ward, a local activist.",

This has in turn exacerbated the global shortage as India is the world's biggest producer of Covid shots.\n\nIn London, foreign ministers from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies committed to financially support the vaccine-sharing program, Covax.\n\nBut there was no immediate announcement on fresh funding.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Denmark, where the spread of the virus has been deemed under control, will open up cinemas and theaters plus gyms and fitness centers Thursday. And bars, cafes and restaurants, which have already reopened, will no longer require reservations.\n\nAll patrons, however, must present a \"corona pass\" certificate confirming they have either tested negative in the past 72 hours, been vaccinated or recently recovered from Covid-19.\n\nVaccine inequity\n\nThe pandemic has claimed more than 3.2 million lives worldwide since it first emerged in late 2019, but many wealthy nations have made progress in suppressing the virus as mass vaccination campaigns gather steam.\n\nMore than 1.2 billion doses have been administered globally, but fewer than one percent in the least developed countries.\n\nVaccine shortages are not an issue in the United States, which could soon be sitting on as many as 300 million extra doses -- nearly equivalent to its entire population.\n\nBiden on Tuesday said he wanted 70 percent of US adults to have received at least one shot by the July 4 Independence Day holiday.\n\nHe also said his administration was \"ready to move immediately\" if regulators authorize the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds.\n\nBut some experts question the wisdom of devoting limited vaccine supplies to a low-risk group instead of sharing them with high-risk groups abroad.\n\nIn the Middle East, Egypt announced a partial shutdown of malls and restaurants and called off festivities for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr to curb rising coronavirus cases.\n\nAnd on Wednesday Argentina broke its record for Covid-19 deaths with 633 recorded fatalities in 24 hours, despite stepped-up measures to reduce movement of people across the country.",

    "Text": "Written by Valeriya Safronova\n\nAs experts in philanthropy, finance, technology and global health scramble to predict what the divorce of Melinda and Bill Gates could mean for their industries, others are wondering: Who will get their lakefront estate in the Seattle suburbs, which is valued at upward of $131 million? And will the public finally get a peek inside?\n\nThe couple, worth an estimated $124 billion according to Forbes, announced their split in a joint statement posted to their social media profiles Monday. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, of which they are co-chairs, said that nothing will change in its organizational structure.\n\nBut their 66,000-square-foot home on the shore of Lake Washington is another matter. The sprawling complex \u2014 which, at the time of a 1995 New York Times story, included a spa, a 60-foot pool, a gym paneled with stone from a mountain peak in the Pacific Northwest, a trampoline room, and a stream for salmon, trout and other fish \u2014 got the nickname Xanadu 2.0 from Gates\u2019 biographers.\n\n(Xanadu is the name of a large, lavish property that belongs to the tycoon at the heart of the film \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d The 2.0 refers to Gates\u2019 technological innovations.)\n\nThe details of the waterfront compound have been kept incredibly private by the Gates family \u2014 so much so that a tour of the property went for $35,000 at a charity auction in 2009, according to TechCrunch. The Gateses own multiple other parcels of land surrounding the main property, according to public records, so walking by to catch a glimpse is out of the question.\n\nBut an intern for Microsoft who made it inside in 2007 was allowed to write about the visit on the company\u2019s blog. According to his account, the house is built out of \u201corangey wood\u201d and the sand on the beach is imported from Hawaii. The wood is Douglas fir; the origin of the sand, unconfirmed. (\u201cGoing down Bill\u2019s driveway is like arriving at Jurassic Park,\u201d the intern wrote. \u201cThe landscaping is just insane.\u201d)\n\nOther known details about the house are that it was divided into pavilions that were terraced into a 170-foot hill and that it was designed by architects James Cutler and Peter Bohlin. Bohlin\u2019s firm later designed the famous Apple cube at the company\u2019s store on Fifth Avenue in New York.\n\nAnd, Melinda Gates once said that the mansion caused her to have a \u201cmini sort of personal crisis.\u201d\n\nBill Gates was already working on his dream home before marrying Melinda Gates in 1994. But construction was halted when she arrived on the scene. The place was \u201ca bachelor\u2019s dream and a bride\u2019s nightmare,\u201d according to a 2008 profile of Melinda Gates in Fortune magazine, with \u201cenough software and high-tech displays to make a newlywed feel as though she were living inside a video game.\u201d\n\n(A decade later, Melinda Gates was similarly grim: \u201cJust to be clear, the house was being built before I came on the scene,\u201d she said in a 2019 New York Times interview. \u201cBut I take responsibility for it.\u201d)\n\nAfter six months of discussions about whether the entire project should be scrapped, Melinda Gates decided to influence further construction by incorporating her preferences \u2014 and insisted on making the place a home for a family and not a lone tech wizard. To that end, she hired interior designer Thierry Despont, who has been the creative mind behind the restoration of famous interiors like the Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel in New York and the Ritz in Paris.\n\nStill, Bill Gates made big promises about the house\u2019s technological powers in his 1995 book, \u201cThe Road Ahead.\u201d He described his vision of a smart home where guests would be given badges that would communicate with sensors around the house. As they moved through the rooms, lights would dim or brighten, music would play and the temperature would automatically adjust to their preference. It\u2019s not clear whether these plans panned out.\n\nAnother aspect of Bill Gates\u2019 vision was to turn the walls into video screens where he would be able to display digitized works of art. As the house was being built, Gates began to purchase the electronic rights to world-famous pieces from museums like the National Gallery in London through a company called Interactive Home Systems.\n\nThese acquisitions were part of an entrepreneurial experiment: Gates imagined that in the future, other people would be able to decorate their homes with digitized artworks just like he was attempting to do. His vision didn\u2019t come to fruition. (Interactive Home Systems became Corbis, a rich photography archive, which later sold its image and licensing division to a Chinese company.)\n\nPerhaps Gates may now recommit himself to designing and building a smart house (though that may not be a challenging project for him today, now that connected devices are everywhere).\n\nBecause despite the changes she made to the couple\u2019s home, Melinda Gates recently expressed misgivings about continuing to live there.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t have that house forever,\u201d she told The Times in 2019. \u201cI\u2019m actually really looking forward to the day that Bill and I live in a 1,500-square foot house.\u201d",

(Adam Schultz/The White House via The New York Times)\n\nWritten by Heather Murphy\n\nIt was a pleasant 86 or so degrees in Plains, Georgia, when President Joe Biden and Jill Biden visited former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, at their home on April 29.\n\nJill Biden wore a dress covered in lemons and two delicate silver bracelets. Rosalynn Carter was dressed more casually in a white long-sleeved T-shirt, sneakers and a smartwatch. Joe Biden wore a royal-blue suit, and Jimmy Carter a sport coat over a T-shirt.\n\n\u201cWe just had a nice time,\u201d the current president said later.\n\nReporters were not permitted inside, but a photo of the two couples that the Carter Center posted Monday on Twitter \u2014 with its toothy grins and teacups \u2014 seemed to back this up.\n\nExcept one thing was off: At some point during the visit, the Bidens appeared to have turned into giants.\n\nJill Biden is 5-foot-6. So far as the world knows. Jimmy Carter, 96, stood around 5-foot-10 at his tallest. But even kneeling, she appeared to dwarf him. And Joe Biden, who is 6 feet tall, seemed to hover above the man he had come to pay his respects to. It was as if the hosts had been turned into Hobbits.\n\n\u201cDid they pull some Gandalf/Hobbit perspective trickery or are the Biden\u2019s actually this gigantic?\u201d, one man asked on Twitter. Another user asked if she was \u201cthe only one who thinks this looks like a tiny doll museum, and Joe and Jill are giants?\u201d\n\nIn a thread on Reddit that was full of Hobbit jokes, others countered that perhaps age had shrunk the former president to 3 feet. Or maybe, some wondered, there was something going on with the lens.\n\nSo which is it?\n\nReached by phone, chief official White House photographer Adam Schultz confirmed that he took the photo but declined to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s for people to figure out and think about,\u201d he said.\n\nThe answer can be found in Jimmy Carter\u2019s gigantic shoes, said Pete Souza, a former chief official White House photographer for President Barack Obama. Compared to the rest of him they look huge.\n\n\u201cThat to me is an indication that the foreground was distorted by a super-wide-angle lens,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch lenses can be helpful when a photographer is trying to shoot several people in a small room and cannot get far back enough to get everyone in the same frame with another lens. But they are notorious for distorting proportions, Souza said.\n\nJaron Schneider, the editor-in-chief of PetaPixel, a photography and camera news website, had a similar theory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called perspective distortion,\u201d he said.\n\nWide-angle lenses make objects closer to the camera appear to be much larger than objects that are even just a tiny bit farther away.\n\nBecause the Carters are leaning back, the wide-angle lens exaggerates the few inches between them and the Bidens, Schneider said. Had the Bidens and Carters been seated on exactly the same plane, this effect would not have been so striking. This is why the two men\u2019s shoes seem to be on a similar scale.\n\nThe placement of the chairs also exacerbates the distortion, he said. The center of a wide-angle photo tends to look natural. But once you start moving toward the edge of the photo, the proportions get increasingly distorted. Had everyone been huddled around the lamp, the effect would not have been so noticeable.\n\n\u201cWide-angle lenses have this angle no matter how optically correct they,\u201d Schneider said, adding that these sorts of optical distortions can be fixed in post production.\n\nBut while editing the photo may have made it look more realistic, that would be frowned upon, said Doug Mills, a photographer assigned to the Washington bureau of The New York Times.\n\nMills was outside the Carters\u2019 home during the photo session and saw the flash go off inside. He agreed that it seemed likely that a wide-angle lens was used to solve the problem of capturing all four subjects in a small space\n\nSome asked why the Carter Center would release a distorted photo, or why it was not edited to remove the distortion.\n\n\u201cThat would be completely forbidden,\u201d Mills said. Official White House photographers are supposed to abide by ethical rules similar to those followed by photojournalists, he said.\n\nThe picture, for all its amusing flaws, is history.",

    "Text": "On April 26, China\u2019s state-run Sichuan Airlines suspended cargo flights to India for 15 days amid an alarming second Covid-19 outbreak there. (Representational)\n\nDrugmakers in India are warning that a halt on some cargo flights from China could imperil an important link in the global pharmaceutical supply chain. The U.S. relies heavily on India to stock its medicine cabinets, and any slowdown in output could leave pharmacies short of drugs used regularly by millions of Americans.\n\nOn April 26, China\u2019s state-run Sichuan Airlines suspended cargo flights to India for 15 days amid an alarming second Covid-19 outbreak there. China supplies 60% to 70% of the raw materials used by India\u2019s drugmakers, as well as ingredients for finished medicines sent to markets worldwide, according to Mahesh Doshi, national president for the Indian Drug Manufacturers\u2019 Association.\n\nIf the flights remain on hold, the drug industry fears \u201ccascading effects on its entire supply chain,\u201d Doshi wrote in an April 29 letter to India\u2019s external affairs minister. That could lead to domestic shortages of essential medicines and have a severe impact on exports, she said.\n\nSichuan Airlines didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment made outside of normal business hours during a holiday in China.\n\nDrugmakers are normally secretive about where medicines are produced. However, the U.S. Pharmacopeia, which helps the industry maintain quality controls, has started a project to pinpoint as much manufacturing as possible. Its Medicine Supply Map has identified where 77% of finished generic drugs are made, said spokeswoman Anne Bell.\n\nThere are 62 generic drugs that are produced only in India, Bell said, including several antibacterial treatments and antivirals. India also is home to 31% of active ingredient manufacturing facilities named in applications approved by the U.S., according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nTo this point, there haven\u2019t been any reported shortages due to the outbreak in India, but doctors and health experts have been bracing for impacts. Last year, the U.S. saw deficits of everything from sedatives to inhalers to a depression medication when the pandemic started and parts of China were locked down.\n\n\u201cThis is very reminiscent of where we were right when Covid hit and people were like \u2018What\u2019s happening in China?\u2019\u201d said Erin Fox, a drug-shortage expert with the University of Utah who works closely with the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists. \u201cBecause there\u2019s so much opacity, we don\u2019t know exactly how we could be impacted. There isn\u2019t a lot we can do.\u201d\n\nSireesha Yadlapalli, regional general manager for USP in South Asia, said she has been pleased to see the industry in India hasn\u2019t yet been negatively impacted, but said that the effect of the pause on Sichuan flights could be severe.\n\nProtecting Workers\n\nMany drug companies in India have taken steps to try to protect their workers and keep assembly lines running, even as infections soar. On Tuesday, the country had 382,146 new coronavirus cases, according to Bloomberg data.\n\n\u201cAs of now there is no disruption in production,\u201d said Sudarshan Jain, secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the future, how further it is stretched, but at this moment we are making all preparations, working on all contingencies, to make sure that the medicines are available.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has contacted drugmakers in India as infections in the country soar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dynamic situation,\u201d Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work closely with manufacturers there. We are concerned in several ways: Will they be able to keep up production and continue to manage quality?\u201d\n\nSome drugmakers with plants in India have struggled to meet U.S. quality standards even before the pandemic started. FDA inspectors over the last several years have cited them for ignoring quality failures and in some cases manipulating results from testing meant to ensure drugs\u2019 safety and effectiveness.\n\nThe agency has uncovered similar deficiencies at factories in China and in the U.S. as well, though the generic-drug industry is largely focused around India.\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., one of the largest generic drug companies, said in a letter to customers Tuesday that the supply it originates from India hadn\u2019t yet been interrupted and that it has contingency plans in place should shortfalls occur.\n\n\u201cWe are closely monitoring the evolving situation in India, and are accordingly adapting our business continuity plans,\u201d Christine Baeder, senior vice president of U.S. generics, wrote in the letter.\n\nTeva\u2019s factories in India aren\u2019t among those the FDA has warned for failing to meet quality standards.\n\nUnpredictable Effects\n\nIf drug output in India slows, it could have unpredictable consequences globally. Companies in India such as Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories Ltd. make a significant share of generic medicines taken by Americans. At the same time, many U.S. and European drug giants have set up manufacturing in India, drawn by low wages and less-stringent regulation.\n\nSun Weidong, China\u2019s ambassador to India, has tweeted support for India over the last week and said China is encouraging companies to help fulfill India\u2019s need for medical supplies. On Saturday, Weidong said 61 cargo flights have operated between China and India in the previous two weeks.\n\nAbout 4 million people work in India\u2019s pharmaceutical industry. Attendance at drug factories is down slightly but not enough to impact production, according to Jain of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance and Ashok Kumar Madan, executive director of the Indian Drug Manufacturers\u2019 Association, but some states have imposed full or partial lockdowns.\n\nIf the crisis worsens, more workers could be kept away from factories. According to the U.S. Pharmacopeia, 32% of factories in India that produce active pharmaceutical ingredients are in cites currently under some kind of lockdown, representing about 6% of global output.\n\nCompanies are keeping factory workers distanced and meet weekly to discuss the supply chain, Jain and Madan said. They also said some companies have hired their own buses to transport workers rather than having them use public transportation.\n\nMany companies hope to be able to vaccinate workers at their plants, though low supply has caused immunization in India to slow. About 9% of India\u2019s almost 1.4 billion people have received one vaccine shot and just 2% are fully vaccinated, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.\n\nSome investors are betting that India\u2019s drugmakers will falter, and that competitors elsewhere will benefit.\n\nShares of Chinese pharmaceutical companies climbed last week after Scarlett Shi, an analyst with Zhongtai International in Hong Kong, said that the situation has stoked speculation that Chinese drugmakers could gain if India\u2019s production falters.",

    "Text": "In this Thursday, June 18, 2020 file photo, Donald Trump looks at his phone during a roundtable with governors on the reopening of America's small businesses, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington. (AP/File)\n\nWritten by Adam Satariano and Cecilia Kang\n\nWhen Facebook barred President Donald Trump from its service in January, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, defended the decision in a Facebook post the morning after the siege of the Capitol. But the first draft was written the night before by Nick Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister who leads the company\u2019s public affairs.\n\nMore than a week later, Clegg urged Zuckerberg to let a new outside panel decide whether to let Trump back on Facebook, employees involved in the deliberations said. Handing over control of one of the most consequential free-speech decisions of the internet age was risky advice, and some in the company wondered if Zuckerberg would agree.\n\n\u201cI defer to you, Nick,\u201d Zuckerberg said, according to Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Facebook who was at the meeting.\n\nOn Wednesday the panel, the Facebook Oversight Board, upheld the decision to suspend Trump\u2019s account, preventing him from posting to Facebook or Instagram. But the board said Facebook had made a mistake imposing an \u201cindefinite\u201d ban, and it called on the company to revisit the ban within six months, to either make it permanent or set a timeline for reinstatement.\n\nClegg played perhaps the biggest behind-the-scenes role in decisions around Trump\u2019s account, colleagues said, an unlikely position for a British political veteran in such an important moment for American free speech. He developed the main justification used by Zuckerberg for barring Trump, and he oversaw the creation of the board, including the selection of its members.\n\nThe board\u2019s ruling on Trump tests the argument that Clegg championed inside Facebook: Instead of taking all the responsibility for moderation, the company should enlist a quasi-judicial board of outside experts to make the final decision. Many have questioned Facebook\u2019s effort to create a global arbiter of speech, including some company employees, arguing in part that it lacks legitimacy because the board is Facebook-funded and stacked with hand-selected representatives.\n\nBut Clegg has said that absent rules from governments, Facebook had few good options other than creating a statelike institution of its own.\n\nClegg, 54, declined to comment for this article. But Facebook made executives available to discuss his role at the company, many on the condition that their names not be published. Clegg also connected The New York Times with several people outside Facebook to speak favorably of him. The Times also spoke with members of the oversight board, academics, political figures, civil society groups and others familiar with Clegg\u2019s work.\n\nClegg joined Facebook in 2018 to oversee its policy and public relations team after his political star had faded. The leader of the left-leaning Liberal Democrats, he was voted out of office in 2017 after alienating supporters by joining Britain\u2019s Conservative Party in forming a coalition government. After Britain increased college tuition, cutouts of Clegg were hanged in effigy by protesters in London.\n\nFacebook wanted Clegg to help repair its relationships with regulators, political leaders and the media after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, when data improperly pulled from Facebook was used by to create voter profiles. Clegg\u2019s international experience and comfort in five languages \u2014 English, Spanish, French, German and Dutch \u2014 appealed to the American-centric company.\n\nFriends said Clegg had initially been reluctant to join Facebook, one of the world\u2019s most polarizing corporations. But he wanted to be back at the center of important political and policy debates. In a memo outlining how he envisioned the role, he argued that it was unsustainable for a private company like Facebook, rather than democratically elected governments, to have so much power, especially on speech-related issues.\n\n\u201cMy advice was strongly to go for it,\u201d said Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, whom Clegg spoke with before taking the job, \u201cbecause you\u2019re going to be part of one of the most powerful companies in the world at a moment of enormous change in the world, and when technology is at the heart of that change.\u201d\n\nInside Facebook, where Zuckerberg leans on a group of friends and early employees for counsel, Clegg earned the trust of his new boss. At the company\u2019s headquarters, where proximity to Zuckerberg is power, Clegg\u2019s desk was placed nearby. He orchestrated a trip through Europe with Zuckerberg, meeting with European Union leaders in Brussels and President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris.\n\nSince Clegg\u2019s arrival, Facebook has shifted some of its policy positions. It now appears more accepting of regulation and higher taxes. He overcame reluctance from Zuckerberg and others in the company to ban political ads in the weeks before Election Day last year. And he was the main internal supporter for recently announced product changes that give users more control over what posts they see in their Facebook feeds.\n\n\u201cHe has a track record of knowing what it\u2019s like to work inside a Cabinet that needs to make decisions quickly and move at the speed of a country, or in this case a platform,\u201d said Chris Cox, Facebook\u2019s chief product officer, who worked with Clegg on the user-control changes.\n\nCritics say Clegg\u2019s role is an attempt by Facebook to use a respected global political figure to soften its image. Despite pledges to accept new government regulation, the company continues to fight strong oversight, policymakers said. Others said changes made by Clegg did not address core problems with the company\u2019s privacy-invading business model, which is optimized to keep people scrolling their Facebook feeds, amplifying divisive and inflammatory content and exaggerating political divisions in society.\n\n\u201c\u2018Are you sure you\u2019re on the right side here?\u2019 That is the question that will get thrown back at Clegg,\u201d said Damian Collins, a Conservative member of the British Parliament who led an investigation of social media in politics. \u201cHe\u2019s taken a lot of money to go work for a company that doesn\u2019t meet the highest ethical standards.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the board\u2019s decision frustrated some critics, who said it showed a level of bureaucracy that the former politician had brought to the company.\n\n\u201cWe did not need a ruling from an illegitimate Facebook board to understand that the corporation was not prepared to address governmental abuse of its platform,\u201d said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who researches social media.\n\nClegg had hoped Wednesday\u2019s judgment would be the final word on Trump\u2019s ban. Instead, the oversight board said Facebook must find a permanent solution on its own, effectively kicking a final decision back to Facebook\u2019s executives.\n\nThe person who Facebook said would lead that decision-making process? Clegg.",

    "Text": "Buddhists from many cultures and communities gather for a ceremony to repair the nation\u2019s racial karma at the Higashi Honganji Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles on May 4, 2021, a temple that had recently been vandalized in an arson attack. (Rozette Rago/The New York Times)\n\nFrom her flower stand on Market Street, Patricia Lee saw the glint of a large blade and then feathers from a winter jacket fly through the air. An older woman buckled to her knees.\n\nIn broad daylight, on one of the busiest streets in San Francisco, two unsuspecting Asian women, one of them 84, had just been attacked by a man with a large military-style knife, officials and witnesses said.\n\n\u201cHe walked right next to me \u2014 I could have been the one who got stabbed,\u201d said Lee, who witnessed the attack Tuesday afternoon. Police arrested Patrick Thompson, 54, who they say carried out the attack, although the motive remained unknown.\n\nThompson was charged Wednesday with attempted murder. Both women were treated for their wounds at a San Francisco hospital and their conditions were described by the police as non-life-threatening.\n\nOver the past several months, Asian Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area have been shoved to the ground, punched and robbed \u2014 attacks that have come amid a rise in anti-Asian hate across the country and the scapegoating of Asian communities for the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe stabbing Tuesday has only added to the anxiety of a large segment of the city\u2019s population. Community organizations and the San Francisco police recently introduced a Mandarin and Cantonese hotline to report crimes and attacks.\n\n\u201cThe community is reeling from the onslaught of brutality against defenseless and fragile people,\u201d said David Lee, an activist in the city\u2019s Chinese community who is in the same family association as the 84-year-old victim. \u201cIt speaks to the violence, the lawlessness, the lack of civic responsibility and order on the streets of San Francisco right now.\u201d\n\nAfter a year of aggressive and effective measures against the coronavirus, San Francisco has been opening back up. There were about 15 people waiting Tuesday at the bus stop where the two women were stabbed, one sign that the city is coming back to life. Yet many say the pandemic has contributed to two other crises: a drug overdose epidemic that killed twice as many people in the city as the coronavirus did last year, and the string of violence against Asians.\n\nAsian American grandparents who spent months stuck inside during lockdowns are now afraid to go outdoors, said Carl Chan, the president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce.\n\nChan has been one of the most prominent voices in the Bay Area Chinese community raising concerns about the attacks. In a measure of how common they have become, Chan himself was assaulted on a street in Oakland last week. On his way to visit a 69-year-old Chinese man who was recuperating after being attacked with a cane on a public bus, Chan was punched in the head by a man who called him a racial slur.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned,\u201d Chan said Wednesday of the continued violence against Asians. \u201cWe have to stand up no matter how many attacks and stop this craziness.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, the police and prosecutors have struggled to establish a motive. A spokesperson for the San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Office, Rachel Marshall, said five people in the city have been charged with anti-Asian hate crimes this year. Others have been charged with elder abuse, including a 19-year-old man who was accused of fatally assaulting Vicha Ratanapakdee, a retired bank auditor from Thailand, on a chilly January morning.\n\nMany of the assaults have occurred in and around the Tenderloin, a district that struggles with some of the city\u2019s most intractable social problems, including people suffering from mental illness and drug addiction who often live on the streets.\n\nTwo attacks in March carried out by a man the police identified as Steven Jenkins, 39, illustrate the hazy ambiguity that the street conditions can bring to some of these attacks.\n\nThe authorities said Jenkins attacked a 75-year-old Chinese grandmother and an 83-year-old Vietnamese man, assaults that gained national attention because the grandmother, Xiao Zhen Xie, fought Jenkins with a small plank. Jenkins was arrested and charged with assault, battery and elder abuse. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nLawyers for Jenkins said he had been homeless for a decade and suffered from mental illness. The public defender\u2019s office released security camera footage showing a chaotic set of circumstances leading up to the point where he attacked Xie. In the video, Jenkins is punched by several people before he turns to strike Xie.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of desperate people out there now,\u201d said Danny Yu Chang, a travel agent from the Philippines, who was knocked unconscious by an attacker in March as he returned to his downtown San Francisco office after lunch.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer right now to stay at home,\u201d Yu Chang said.\n\nA relative of Vicha, the retired bank auditor who was killed in January, said he saw a progression during the pandemic that began with Asians being spit upon and blamed for the virus but later escalated to physical attacks.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the pandemic, it was Trump-inspired, hate-filled verbal attacks,\u201d said Vicha\u2019s son-in-law, Eric Lawson. \u201cNow it\u2019s become violent.\u201d\n\nLee, the community activist, said the constant barrage of videos and reports showing attacks on Asians has been particularly wearing.\n\n\u201cEvery time we see a story that is the worst, we\u2019ve seen another one comes along,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is this escalation of horrors that never seems to end.\u201d",

    "Text": "Written by Nick Corasaniti and Shane Goldmacher\n\nFacebook\u2019s decision Wednesday to keep former President Donald Trump off its platform could have significant consequences for his political operation as he tries to remain the leader of the Republican Party, thwarting his ability to amplify his message to tens of millions of followers and hampering his fundraising ability.\n\nFacebook has increasingly become one of the most vital weapons in a political campaign\u2019s arsenal, with its ability to juice small-dollar online-fundraising numbers into the millions, expand and acquire contact information, help build out data on a campaign\u2019s voter file and provide the most sophisticated advertising platform available.\n\nFew campaigns had tapped into Facebook\u2019s potential for advertising and fundraising as aggressively as Trump\u2019s. His successful 2016 campaign said its prolific use of Facebook had allowed it to send millions of different, hypertargeted political ads to small slices of the population.\n\n\u201cFacebook was the method,\u201d Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager in 2020 and digital director in 2016, told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2017. \u201cIt was the highway which his car drove on.\u201d\n\nThat continued in 2020, as his reelection operation devoted a nine-figure budget to Facebook advertising. And much as he did with his Twitter account, Trump often turned to Facebook\u2019s advertising platform in times of political crisis.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial, in September 2019, his campaign began flooding Facebook with ads criticizing the impeachment as a hoax and subversive effort by far-left Democrats.\n\nAlthough Trump is out of office and living at his resort in Florida, he retains broad influence over the Republican Party. But his platform for reaching Americans has diminished greatly without access to big social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which has permanently suspended him. Some Trump aides think that the absence of Facebook, which was crucial to his success in 2016, will hinder him if he decides to run again in 2024, which he has told several advisers is his plan.\n\nFacebook\u2019s ruling was delivered by an oversight board, which also said the company\u2019s indefinite suspension was \u201cnot appropriate\u2019\u2019 and gave Facebook six months to come up with a final decision on whether Trump would regain access.\n\nHis Facebook ads proved a useful tool to draw big crowds to his signature rallies. Days before the president was scheduled to arrive in a given city, Facebook users around the region would begin seeing ads about the rally, with a link to sign up for a free ticket.\n\nThe decision by Facebook does not immediately hamper Trump\u2019s fundraising ability \u2014 he still maintains control of a large number of supporter email addresses and phone numbers. But fundraising lists must be continually refreshed, and Facebook has proved a crucial place for Trump to do so.\n\n\u201cHe has the best fundraising list, but that decays over time if you\u2019re not adding back into it,\u201d said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist. \u201cSo because they don\u2019t have the ability to run ads on Facebook, they\u2019re losing out on petitions to grow their email list, surveys, things like that \u2014 the tactics that every campaign has to be doing 365 to really maintain their fundraising.\u201d\n\nThroughout 2020, the Trump campaign would run ads asking users to \u201ctake this SOCIALISM poll\u201d or \u201cWish Melania a Happy Birthday,\u201d which would help keep lists current and occasionally expand or add new names to their lists \u2014 or even spur a direct donation.\n\nIn recent days, Trump\u2019s operation has begun to more aggressively solicit supporters for cash via text message, including one reacting to the Facebook decision on Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump\u2019s team announced he would begin posting his thoughts on political developments to his own website, trying to brand it as the \u201cFrom the Desk of Donald J. Trump.\u201d But the power of Trump\u2019s pronouncements on social media had been their ability to ricochet quickly across the web and into the streams of his supporters \u2014 something far harder to achieve while being deplatformed.\n\nBut even without Facebook, some Republican strategists note that Trump still has one of the largest megaphones in the world, simply because of the public interest in his plans, which might lessen the impact of Facebook\u2019s ban.\n\n\u201cI compare it to somebody who has a sprained ankle,\u201d said Tim Cameron, a Republican digital strategist. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hobbling for a little bit, and he\u2019s not going to be at the strength that he would be with the ability to reach people on Facebook and other social platforms, but it\u2019s certainly not something that\u2019s going to stop him.\u201d\n\nEven with the Facebook spigot turned off since January, Trump began the spring with more than $85 million in his various political committees, according to an adviser, after banking tens of millions of dollars that he raised after the election.\n\nBut perhaps most immediately, the ban against running any political ads hampers one of Trump\u2019s most current prized roles: Republican primary kingmaker.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really committed to settling scores and making sure his allies get boosted,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey won\u2019t have access to Facebook to help the candidates he wants to support in the primaries in 2022.\u201d",

    "Text": "The Americans had claimed self-defence in court (Representational)\n\nAn Italian court convicted two young Americans Wednesday for the murder of a police officer while they were on a summer holiday in Rome, with both handed life sentences.\n\nFinnegan Lee Elder, 21, had admitted stabbing Mario Cerciello Rega during a late-night encounter in July 2019, while out with his friend Gabriel Natale-Hjorth, 20.\n\nProsecutors claimed it was a brutal, unprovoked attack in which Elder, then 19, stabbed Cerciello 11 times with a seven-inch camping knife.\n\nThe Americans had claimed self-defence, saying they were jumped from behind by men they thought were thugs following an earlier drug deal gone wrong.\n\nReading out the verdict, Judge Marina Finiti declared the Americans \"guilty of the offences ascribed to them jointly\" and sentenced them both to \"life imprisonment with solitary confinement for a period of two months, in addition to payment of the costs of the trial\".\n\nBoth were remanded in custody.\n\nThe policeman's widow, Rosa Maria Esilo, sobbed audibly and hugged his brother, an AFP reporter in court said.\n\nAs his lawyer whispered to him with his hand on his shoulder, Elder appeared close to fainting and was rushed out of the courtroom by police.\n\nNatale-Hjorth did not handle the murder weapon but helped to hide it and under Italian law faced the same homicide charge.\n\nThe case, which scandalised Italy while also raising doubts about police conduct, hinged on whether the men from California -- who have been in jail since their arrest almost two years ago -- knew the officers were police.\n\nThey said neither officer showed their badges nor identified themselves as police before the 32-second attack, an account refuted by the state's principal witness, Cerciello's partner Andrea Varriale, 27.\n\n\"We approached them from the front... we presented ourselves as belonging to the carabinieri (police),\" Varriale told the jury during his testimony last year.\n\n\"We approached and unfortunately they immediately assaulted us.\"\n\nPolice inconsistencies\n\nThe death of Cerciello, who had just returned from his honeymoon when he was killed, aroused an outpouring of public sympathy in Italy, and his funeral was broadcast live on television where he was hailed as a hero.\n\nBut the case similarly highlighted a series of inconsistent statements and blunders made by police, including Natale-Hjorth's blindfolding during his police interrogation, a falsified police report and Varriale's lie that he was armed at the time of the attack.\n\nDuring closing arguments, defence lawyers sought to show that the failure of police to follow protocol the night of the attack suggested that Varriale was an unreliable witness and was covering up how the attack unfolded.\n\nThe jury, said Elder attorney Roberto Capra, should consider \"if the system is ready to reject the authoritarian idea that law enforcement can be believed at any cost, that they can say whatsoever and be believed because they belong to the police\".\n\nThe case has sparked comparisons with the high-profile trial of Amanda Knox, a US student convicted and later acquitted of a 2007 murder in Italy.\n\n\"Shock and terror\"\n\nA confusing web of events led to the altercation in the early hours of the morning in a genteel neighbourhood near the Americans' four-star hotel, beginning with their search for cocaine.\n\nAfter an intermediary introduced them to a drug dealer who sold them aspirin instead, the teens stole the bag of the go-between in retaliation, later demanding money and drugs to return it.\n\nThe dealer was actually an informant, and after the bag's theft was reported to police, Cerciello and Varriale showed up at the designated exchange point -- where the attack happened.\n\nNatale-Hjorth, who scuffled with Varriale during the encounter, said he did not know his friend was carrying a knife before the attack, yet helped him hide it afterwards in their hotel room's ceiling panel.\n\nElder did not testify during the trial, but in statements made to the court, he apologised for taking Cerciello's life and said he would never forgive himself. Yet he reiterated his account of the events, describing \"shock and terror\" at being set upon by a stranger.\n\n\"I've realised it's difficult to believe a person in my position. But what I'm telling you today is the truth, just as I spoke the truth at the time,\" he said.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

All the restrictions, which cover around 5.3 million people in the country's biggest metropolitan area, take effect at 5 p.m. local time and are scheduled to last until Monday morning.\n\n\"We believe this is a proportionate response to the risk we have ahead of us,\" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.\n\nThe measures, which also cover Sydney's neighbouring regions of Wollongong, the Central Coast and Blue Mountains, were spurred by the detection of COVID-19 in a 50-year-old man, who passed the infection to his wife.\n\nThe case, the first local transmission in NSW in more than a month, baffled health officials given the man had no known links to high-risk jobs or people.\n\nTesting has determined the man was infected with a variant first detected in India and genomic sequencing had linked the case to a returned traveller from the United States, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said on Thursday, but there was no clear transmission path between the two people.\n\n\"We can't find any direct link between our case, so what we're concerned about is there is another person that is as yet unidentified that infected our case,\" Mr Chant said.\n\nIt appeared to be the first time officials had reported the local transmission of an India virus variant in Australia.\n\nTests on the infected man had showed a higher viral load than typically seen in infected people, potentially increasing the chance that the man has spread the disease, officials said.\n\nNSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet entered self-isolation on Thursday after he visited a restaurant at the same time as the infected person, classifying him as a close contact, his office said. Perrottet, who attended a sitting of state parliament on Wednesday, has tested negative.\n\nAuthorities also asked thousands of residents in the city's inner west to seek testing for any mild flu symptoms after fragments of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 were detected in the sewerage network used by several suburbs.\n\nSpeedy tracing systems, movement curbs and border restrictions have largely reined in the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, which has recorded 29,865 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nINDIA BAN\n\nThe federal government is currently under pressure to overturn a temporary travel ban on travellers, including its own citizens, from COVID-ravaged India. Australia has blocked all direct flights from the country until May 15.\n\nA report in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday, citing unidentified sources, said at least two repatriation flights will be dispatched to India every week from the middle of this month to bring home around 9,000 Australians.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison, however, said the situation would be constantly reviewed.\n\n\"We are not going to commit to that at this point,\" Mr Morrison told radio station 3AW on Thursday.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

    "Text": "India is not a G7 member but was invited by Britain to this week's meeting\n\nThe Group of Seven meeting in London was hit by a COVID-19 scare on Wednesday when India's foreign minister and his entire team said they were self-isolating after two delegation members tested positive.\n\nBritain is hosting the three-day foreign ministers' meeting - the first such G7 event in two years - which has been billed as a chance to restart face-to-face diplomacy and a opportunity for the West to show a united front against threats from China and Russia.\n\nIndia, currently undergoing the world's worst surge in COVID-19 cases, is attending the G7 as a guest and had been due to take part in meetings on Tuesday evening and throughout Wednesday.\n\n\"Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid positive cases,\" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Twitter.\n\n\"As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well.\"\n\nThe meeting is a precursor to a G7 summit due to take place at a rural English resort in June, with U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders set to attend.\n\nA British official confirmed the two positive tests and said the entire Indian delegation was self-isolating. British rules require a 10-day self-isolation period.\n\nThe Indian delegation had not yet attended the main summit venue at Lancaster House, and so meetings scheduled for Wednesday went ahead as planned.\n\nAsked if, in light of the positive tests, it had been a mistake to hold the summit in person, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"I think it's very important to try to continue as much business as you can as a government.\"\n\nJohnson said he would speak with S Jaishankar later on Wednesday by Zoom.\n\nBritish foreign minister Dominic Raab said rules had been meticulously applied and had worked effectively and it remained important for the summit in June to go ahead.\n\n\"We know these systems work, we will be able to plan even more, and even more carefully,\" he told reporters.\n\nA final communique from the meeting scolded China and Russia, but provided few concrete measures.\n\nFIST BUMPING\n\nEarlier, Raab was seen greeting and fist-bumping other G7 members as they arrived at the venue.\n\n\"We deeply regret that S Jaishankar will be unable to attend the meeting today in person,\" a senior UK diplomat said. \"This is exactly why we have put in place strict COVID protocols and daily testing.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, pictures from inside the grand Lancaster House conference venue showed the reality of diplomacy in the coronavirus age - delegates separated by plastic screens, and a \"family photo\" of ministers carefully spaced two metres apart.\n\nS Jaishankar was pictured meeting British interior minister Priti Patel on Tuesday, although Patel did not have to self-isolate because the meeting had been held in line with existing rules. Both were wearing masks in the photograph.\n\nIndia is not a G7 member but was invited by Britain to this week's meeting, along with Australia, South Africa and South Korea.\n\nThe Indian High Commission in London did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "Text": "Facebook oversight board said company was right to ban Trump after the Jan 6 storming of the US Capitol\n\nFacebook oversight board on Wednesday upheld the company's suspension of former US President Donald Trump but said the company was wrong to make the suspension indefinite and gave it six months to determine a \"proportionate response.\"\n\nTrump called the decision and his banning across tech platforms \"a total disgrace\" and said the companies would \"pay a political price.\"\n\nThe much-awaited board verdict has been watched for signals on how the world's largest social media company will treat rule-breaking political leaders in the future, a key area of controversy for online platforms.\n\nThe board, created by Facebook to rule on a small slice of its content decisions, said the company was right to ban Trump following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by pro-Trump supporters.\n\nFacebook indefinitely blocked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 riot. It enacted the suspension after removing two of Trump's posts during the Capitol riot, including a video in which he said supporters should go home but reiterated his false claim of widespread voter fraud, saying \"I know your pain. I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us.\"\n\nBut the board said Facebook inappropriately imposed a suspension without clear standards and that the company should determine a response consistent with rules applied to other users. It said the company could determine that Trump's account could be restored, suspended temporarily or permanently banned.\n\n\"Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international or American smell test for clarity, consistency, and transparency,\" said former federal judge Michael McConnell, co-chair of the Oversight Board, during a press conference after publishing its decision on Wednesday.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, board co-chair and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said public figures should not be allowed to incite violence or create harm though their posts, but that Facebook \"can't just invent new sanctions as they go along.\"\n\nIn its decision, the board said Facebook refused to answer some of the 46 questions it posed, including those on how its news feed affected the visibility of Trump's posts, and whether the company planned to look into how its technology amplified content as it had done in the events leading to the Capitol siege.\n\nThe board said Facebook's existing policies, such as deciding when material is too newsworthy to remove, need to be more clearly communicated to users. It also called on Facebook to develop a policy that governs how it handles novel situations where its existing rules would be insufficient to prevent imminent harm.\n\nFacebook's business has thrived during the controversy and its main source of revenue, advertising, has boomed as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions begin to ease in the United States, but lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised concerns about the power of Facebook and other social media, many calling for new regulations and some calling for breakups of big tech.\n\nTrump called the move \"an embarrassment to our Country,\" and added that \"Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before.\"\n\nAt a Financial Times conference after the verdict, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communication, said the company would hope to resolve the matter \"considerably faster\" than six months.\n\nTech platforms have grappled in recent years with how to police world leaders and politicians that violate their guidelines. Facebook has come under fire both from those who think it should abandon its hands-off approach to political speech and those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship.\n\nFacebook was one of a slew of social media sites that barred the former president, including Twitter Inc, which banned him permanently. Political leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders expressed concern that private companies could silence elected officials on their sites.\n\nAt the time of the suspension, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said \"the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\" The company later referred the case to its recently-established board, which includes academics, lawyers and rights activists.\n\nThe binding verdict means Trump will not for now be able to return to Facebook's platforms, where he had a combined 59 million followers across Facebook and Instagram, His campaign spent about $160 million on Facebook ads in 2020, according to Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive's campaign tracker.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump launched a new web page to share messages that readers can then re-post to their Facebook or Twitter accounts. A senior adviser has said Trump also plans to launch his own social media platform.\n\nWednesday's decision marks a milestone for the oversight board, which Facebook financed with $130 million. The body has been hailed as a novel experiment by some researchers but criticized by those who have been skeptical about its independence or view it as a PR stunt to deflect attention from the company's more systemic problems.\n\n\"This verdict is a desperate attempt to have it both ways, upholding the 'ban' of Donald Trump without actually banning him, while punting any real decisions back to Facebook,\" said a group of academics, experts and Facebook critics known as the \"Real Facebook Oversight Board.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

James Vaupel, the founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and a staunch critic of the idea that the human life span has reached its limit, called the study a travesty and told the science journalist Hester van Santen that the authors \u201cjust shoveled the data into their computer like you\u2019d shovel food into a cow.\u201d\n\nRobine remembers the furor well. He was one of several peer reviewers whom Nature recruited to evaluate the study by Vijg and his co-authors before publication. The first draft did not satisfy Robine\u2019s standards, because it focused only on the United States and relied on data he considered incomplete. Among other changes, he recommended using the more comprehensive International Database on Longevity, which he and Vaupel developed with colleagues. Van Santen reported in a peer-review post-mortem that, based on the substantial criticism by Robine and one of the other reviewers, Nature initially declined to publish the study. After Vijg and his co-authors sent Nature a thoroughly revised version, however, Robine conceded that the study was sound enough to publish, though he still disagreed with its conclusions. (Vijg stands by the methodology and conclusions of the study.)\n\nTwo years later, in 2018, the equally prestigious journal Science published a study that completely contradicted the one in Nature. The demographers Elisabetta Barbi of the University of Rome and Kenneth Wachter of the University of California, Berkeley, along with several colleagues, examined the survival trajectories of nearly 4,000 Italians and concluded that, while the risk of death increased exponentially up to age 80, it then slowed and eventually plateaued. Someone alive at 105 had about a 50 percent chance of living to the next year. The same was true at 106, 107, 108 and 109. Their findings, the authors wrote, \u201cstrongly suggest that longevity is continuing to increase over time, and that a limit, if any, has not been reached.\u201d\n\nMany of the disputes over human longevity studies center on the integrity of different data sets and the varying statistical methods researchers use to analyze them. Where one group of scientists perceives a clear trend, another suspects an illusion. Robine finds the debate exciting and essential. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced by my colleagues\u2019 suggesting that life is or is not limited,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think the question is still here. We don\u2019t yet know the best kind of analysis or study design to use to tackle this question. The most important thing to do today is to keep collecting the data.\u201d\n\nOn their own, however, life-span statistics can tell us only so much. Such data have been available for centuries and have clearly not settled the debate. The number of supercentenarians may still be too small to support unequivocal conclusions about mortality rates in extreme old age. But in more recent decades, scientists have made considerable progress toward understanding the evolutionary origins of longevity and the biology of aging. Instead of fixating on human demographics, this research considers all species on the planet and tries to derive general principles about duration of life and timing of death.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little surprised that anyone today would question whether or not there is a limit,\u201d S. Jay Olshansky, an expert on longevity and a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, told me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter whether there is a plateau of mortality or not in extreme old age. There are so few people that make it up there, and the risk of death at that point is so high, that most people aren\u2019t going to live much beyond the limits we see today.\u201d\n\nOlshansky, 67, has argued for decades that life span is obviously limited and that the mathematical models of feuding demographers are secondary to the biological realities of aging. He likes to make an analogy to athletics: \u201cCould someone run a two-minute mile? No. The human body is incapable of moving that fast based on anatomical limitations. The same thing applies to human longevity.\u201d"}, {"Article Image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/27/nyregion/27virus-briefing-NY-walk-in1/merlin_186101916_c3e7145c-12d2-41df-a4dc-1109e06b5991-facebookJumbo.jpg", "Article's Title": "Any eligible adult in New York will be able to walk in for vaccination at state-run sites.", "Article's Text": "All state-run mass coronavirus vaccination sites in New York will allow anyone 16 or older to walk in without an appointment and get their first dose, beginning on Thursday, Gov.

Karsten Moran for The New York Times The leaders of the New York State Legislature said Tuesday they would move on the next day to suspend a pandemic directive that required customers to order food when purchasing alcohol at bars and restaurants. The food directive was originally imposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in July 2020 in an attempt to keep patrons seated at tables and reduce mingling that could lead to large crowded gatherings, fueling the spread of the virus. The repeal of the rule would go into effect after passing both legislative chambers in Albany, which could happen this week. The rule had been criticized by many, including the restaurant industry and many Republican lawmakers, as arbitrary and an unfair business regulation economically detrimental to bars that weren\u2019t accustomed to serving food. While some bars and restaurants had begun to eschew the directive in recent months, others were using creative workarounds to comply with the rule, providing the bare minimum and cheapest option that would count as \u201cfood\u201d under the governor\u2019s directive. For months, New Yorkers were compelled to pair their beer or cocktail order with microwaveable hot dogs, barely cooked grilled cheeses, hastily-prepared peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and, of course, \u201cCuomo chips.\u201d On Tuesday, many on social media were in a jocular and nostalgic mood as they bade farewell to the restriction and the eclectic food items they had been forced to order to enjoy an alcoholic drink over the past nine months. \u201cRest in peace to the Cuomoritos (a $1 bag of Doritos) the place near us has been selling,\u201d wrote one person. Another user wrote: \u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, random bag of lays chips.\u201d The announcement was the latest in a series of restrictions that officials have eased as more people in the state are vaccinated and government officials increasingly turn their attention to New York\u2019s economic recovery. Last month, Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, expanded indoor dining capacity for New York City restaurants to 50 percent, up from 35 percent. And earlier this month, he extended the curfew for bars and restaurants from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. The restaurant industry welcomed the announcement, while calling for other restrictions to also be lifted. \u201cThe public health justification for the food rule was always questionable, so this is good news because it is past time to repeal it,\u201d said Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, an industry group. \u201cBut the state also needs to repeal the rule prohibiting customers from sitting at a bar in New York City, which doesn\u2019t make sense when you can sit at a table six feet away, and they should modify the midnight curfew.\u201d The move by the legislature comes a few months after it curtailed Mr. Cuomo\u2019s emergency powers, a sharp rebuke to the governor that gave lawmakers additional oversight over the pandemic response. Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo, said on Tuesday that, given the state\u2019s coronavirus data, \u201clifting this Covid-related restriction was something we were in the process of implementing in the coming days.\u201d\n\nVaccinated Americans don\u2019t need masks outdoors in small groups or when biking and running, the C.D.C. says.

Easing Mask Guidelines President Biden spoke on Tuesday about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors. Cases and deaths are down, down dramatically from where they were when I took office on Jan. 20, and continuing to fall. This is particularly true for a group of Americans that we were most worried about when it came to the virus, senior citizens. When I took office in January, we were losing literally tens of thousands of our seniors each week, grandparents who were loved so dearly, moms and dads, pillars of every community. We have given 215 million shots. And that \u2014 anyone 16 years of age or older is now eligible to get the vaccine now, today, immediately. And because of the extraordinary progress we made in fighting this virus and the progress our scientists have made in learning about how it gets transmitted, earlier today, the C.D.C. made an important announcement: Starting today, if you\u2019re fully vaccinated and you\u2019re outdoors, you need \u2014 and not in a big crowd \u2014 you no longer need to wear a mask. President Biden spoke on Tuesday about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors. Credit Credit... Stephanie Keith for The New York Times The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took a major step on Tuesday toward coaxing Americans into a post-pandemic world, relaxing the rules on mask wearing outdoors as coronavirus cases recede and people increasingly chafe against restrictions. The mask guidance is modest and carefully written: Americans who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus no longer need to wear a mask outdoors while walking, running, hiking or biking alone, or when in small gatherings, including with members of their own households. Masks are still necessary in crowded outdoor venues like sports stadiums, the C.D.C. said. But President Biden hailed it as a landmark moment in the pandemic, wearing a mask as he approached the lectern on a warm spring day on the White House grounds \u2014 and pointedly keeping it off as he walked back into the White House when he was done. \u201cGo get the shot. It\u2019s never been easier,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd once you\u2019re fully vaccinated, you can go without a mask when you\u2019re outside and away from big crowds.\u201d The C.D.C. stopped short of telling even fully vaccinated people that they could shed their masks outdoors altogether \u2014 citing the worrying risk that remains for transmitting the coronavirus, unknown vaccination levels among people in crowds and the still-high caseloads in some regions of the country. The guidance also cautioned even vaccinated people against going without masks in medium-size outdoor gatherings. But even the C.D.C.\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, emphasized a more expansive interpretation, telling reporters at a White House briefing, \u201cWe no longer feel that the vaccinated people require masks outdoors,\u201d outside \u201clarge public venues, such as concerts, stadiums and things like that.\u201d Image Credit... Centers for Disease Control and Prevention On Capitol Hill, a group of Republican lawmakers who are also medical professionals released an advertisement on Tuesday encouraging vaccination, in which they appeared wearing white coats with stethoscopes draped around their necks. Senator Roger Marshall, a freshman Republican from Kansas and a medical doctor, told viewers that the reason to get vaccinated was simple: \u201cSo we can throw away our masks, and live life as free as before.\u201d Mr. Marshall, who organized the effort, said it was based on research conducted by Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster working to reduce vaccine hesitancy among conservatives. In an interview, Mr. Luntz said Mr. Biden\u2019s announcement was a positive step, and could give people who are reluctant to get vaccinated a reason to get their shots. For Mr. Biden, who will address Congress on Wednesday and mark his 100th day in office on Thursday, the C.D.C.\u2019s announcement was a moment to bask in what he called the \u201cstunning progress\u201d Americans had made since he took office. Next week, he said, he will outline a plan \u201cto get us to July 4 as our target date to get life in America closer to normal and begin to celebrate our independence from the virus.\u201d Americans have been whipsawed on the issue of mask wearing since the beginning of the pandemic, when top health officials said people did not need them \u2014 in part because of severe shortages of protective gear for health care workers on the front lines. Masks became the centerpiece of the culture wars that surrounded the pandemic, especially after President Donald J. Trump insisted that they were optional and that he would not wear one.

Walensky of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remarked on Tuesday on the agency\u2019s new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors. Today, C.D.C. is updating our recommendations for fully vaccinated people, and providing guiding principles and sample activities to give people who are fully vaccinated a way to assess their own risk for Covid-19, and determine what situations are safe. If you are fully vaccinated, things are much safer for you than those who are not yet fully vaccinated. If you are fully vaccinated, and want to attend a small outdoor gathering with people who are vaccinated and unvaccinated or dining at an outdoor restaurant with friends from multiple households, the science shows if you are vaccinated, you can do so safely unmasked. On the C.D.C. website, we have posted examples of numerous outdoor activities that are safe to do without a mask if you are fully vaccinated. For vaccinated people, outdoor activities without a mask are safe. However, we continue to recommend masking in crowded outdoor settings and venues, such as packed stadiums and concerts, where there is decreased ability to maintain physical distance and where many unvaccinated people may also be present. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remarked on Tuesday on the agency\u2019s new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors. Credit Credit... Rosem Morton for The New York Times The new guidance on mask-wearing from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday says that masks can be shed for some relatively safe outdoor activities, especially by fully vaccinated people, because the virus does not spread readily outdoors. But there are many circumstances where the new guidance still calls for masks to be worn outdoors, especially by unvaccinated people. Here are some examples from the C.D.C.\u2019s new guidance: Everyone can do without a mask when \u2026 Walking, running, hiking or biking outdoors, alone or with members of the same household.\n\nAttending a small outdoor gathering with fully vaccinated family and friends. Fully vaccinated people can do without a mask when \u2026 Attending a small outdoor gathering with a mixture of fully vaccinated and unvaccinated people.\n\nDining outdoors at a restaurant with people from several households. For these kinds of activities, unvaccinated people should still wear masks and maintain social distance, the C.D.C. says. Everyone should still wear a mask when \u2026 Attending a crowded outdoor event, like a parade, sporting event or live performance.\n\nDoing almost anything indoors that involves contact with people who are not members of your household. Examples include dining indoors at a restaurant; going to the movies, an indoor concert or theatrical performance; attending full-capacity worship services; traveling on an airline flight or riding mass transit; singing in a chorus indoors; taking part in an indoor exercise class; visiting a shopping mall or museum; getting a haircut or manicure; or attending an indoor social gathering. Though most of these activities are much safer for fully vaccinated people than for the unvaccinated, the C.D.C. guidance says that everyone should still wear a mask to protect themselves and others. People are not likely to know the vaccine status of those around them, the guidance says, and it is not yet clear whether fully vaccinated people can still spread the virus while not becoming ill themselves. Unvaccinated people should also maintain social distance, the guidance says.\n\nDespite new C.D.C. mask guidance, the U.S. patchwork of mandates will take time to unravel.

Ariana Drehsler for The New York Times As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered on Tuesday new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors, people across the United States are living under an often confusing patchwork of limits, one that could continue for some time. Before the C.D.C.\u2019s changes on Tuesday, 25 states had some form of statewide mask mandate, as did the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, according to a New York Times tracker of coronavirus restrictions across the country. In 24 other states there was no statewide mask mandate, while in Colorado masks could be required depending upon the number of cases diagnosed in a county. But even within a state, mask mandates can vary based upon county or city. Kansas has no statewide mask mandates, but a number of cities and counties have their own orders. In Colorado, masks must always be worn in specific indoor locations \u2014 like schools, hospitals and government buildings \u2014 but in some counties with a high rate of new cases, they must also be worn in all public indoor settings with 10 or more people. After the C.D.C.\u2019s announcement on Tuesday, a handful of governors said they would relax their outdoor mask mandates. In Massachusetts, masks won\u2019t be required unless it is not possible to social distance. Maine recommends wearing a mask outdoors when it\u2019s difficult to stay distanced, and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Tuesday that \u201cif you\u2019re fully vaccinated, outdoors and not in a large crowd \u2014 you do not need to wear a mask.\u201d Some outdoor mask requirements are even more specific, especially as a number of states have recently loosened orders. Masks are now only required outdoors in Kentucky at events with more than 1,000 people. Delaware recently removed a mask mandate for outdoor low-risk and medium-risk youth sports. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Tuesday that New York would adopt the C.D.C.\u2019s guidance on outdoor mask wearing for vaccinated people. \u201cThat is liberating, especially now that the weather is getting warmer,\u201d he said at a news conference. Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee announced the end of statewide public health orders and issued an executive order that ends the authority of local officials to issue mask requirements in the 89 counties directed by the state health department. He also asked larger counties with their own health departments to lift restrictions like mask requirements by Memorial Day. The mayor of Knox County, which includes Knoxville, said Tuesday afternoon he would end a county mask mandate effective at midnight Tuesday. Louisiana will lift its mask requirement for private businesses like restaurants and bars, Gov. John Bel Edwards said on Tuesday, but will keep the mask mandate for schools, universities and public transit. Mr. Edwards said mask requirements by businesses and local governments should still be adhered to. At a White House news conference on Tuesday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the C.D.C., stopped short of calling for states to end outdoor mask mandates. \u201cStates that have mask requirements outdoors, if people are vaccinated, we no longer feel the vaccinated people require masks outdoors,\u201d she said. She said she continued to worry about protecting unvaccinated people at large outdoor public venues like concerts and sports stadiums. As more than half of all American adults have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, mask mandates are often the last widespread public health order still in effect. Stay-at-home orders and forced business closures, measures sometimes used to try and stop the spread of the virus, have mostly been lifted across the country, though they persist in a few states. See Coronavirus Restrictions and Mask Mandates for All 50 States The rules for businesses and residents remain a patchwork across the country as governors balance curbing the virus with boosting local economies. Kevin Draper and\n\nU.S. pharmacies are told to offer second vaccine doses to people who got first shots elsewhere. A man receiving a vaccine dose in a pharmacy in New York City earlier this month. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times Federal health officials said on Tuesday that they were directing nearly all drugstores and grocery-store pharmacies to offer second doses of Covid-19 vaccines to people who received their first shot from a different provider. Growing numbers of Americans who received a first shot of the two-dose Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna vaccine are not getting their second shots, in part because of challenges with access. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 5 million people, or nearly 8 percent of those who were partially vaccinated, have missed getting their second dose. Though that is not a high rate compared with those seen for multidose vaccines against other conditions, some states have been taking steps to prevent it from rising. The new federal directive is aimed especially at encouraging college students who got their first shots on or near campus to get their second doses at home, according to Andy Slavitt, the White House\u2019s senior adviser for Covid-19 response. To accomplish that, he said, pharmacies participating in a federal vaccine distribution program will set aside any residency requirements for vaccine recipients. College students are a challenging group to get fully vaccinated. Many who became eligible recently got their first shot while still on campus, but will have left for the summer by the time they are due for their second shot. Other recipients may have been unable to get a second appointment at their original provider or had an appointment that was canceled. Many pharmacies were already giving out second vaccine doses to people who got first shots elsewhere. CVS stores, in particular, have become a destination for people scrambling to find a second shot, and a spokeswoman for Walgreens said her company was offering second doses without regard to where the first was administered. New York City officials said on Tuesday that the city has taken a similar approach, allowing people to receive second shots at any city-run site. The problem is less pronounced in the city than it is nationally, with only about 5 percent of city residents missing their second dose, officials said. People can schedule appointments at city sites in advance, or they can walk in. They need to bring proof of their first dose, like a C.D.C. vaccination card or an electronic record, to ensure that they receive the right vaccine within the recommended time. \u201cOur goal here is to keep reminding people to get that second dose however works best,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re going to accommodate them and keep this progress moving.\u201d Dr. Dave Chokshi, the city\u2019s health commissioner, said that getting a second dose at a different location than the first should be a last resort. \u201cWe want people to keep their second-dose appointments if they\u2019ve already made them,\u201d he said. Rebecca Robbins and\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCoronavirus cases are surging in Oregon. Crowds gathered at the Portland Farmers Market at Portland State University in Portland, Ore., this month. Credit... Kristina Barker for The New York Times While coronavirus cases are falling in much of the United States, infections are spiking in Oregon, where a new wave is set to push a third of counties into the most severe level of restrictions. In the past two weeks, virus cases have risen 54 percent and hospitalizations are up 39 percent, according to a New York Times database. A total of 15 counties, including some in the Portland metro area, will move back into the fourth and most extreme level of restrictions by Friday, after meeting the state\u2019s threshold, the governor\u2019s office said on Tuesday. In these counties, indoor dining will be prohibited and businesses such as gyms and movie theaters must significantly reduce capacity. The new limits are likely to prompt a political backlash. Some states that have endured recent surges, like Michigan, where cases have leveled off but still remain high, have chosen not to tighten restrictions again and instead asked residents to take greater precautions in an effort to halt the spread of the virus. \u201cThis is not a step I take lightly,\u201d Oregon\u2019s governor, Kate Brown, said at a news conference last week. \u201cHowever, it could be the last time we need to impose this level of restrictions given our vaccination trends and the virus\u2019 behavior.\u201d Public health experts have suggested a combination of factors could be driving the surge, including more contagious variants, increased travel during spring break and the loosening of state guidelines before vaccination rates had risen sufficiently. As of Tuesday, nearly 30 percent of the state\u2019s population was fully vaccinated and 43 percent had received at least one dose, according to a New York Times database. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get down far enough,\u201d Ken Stedman, a biology professor at Portland State University, told local news outlet KATU, \u201cand now we seem to be going back up again.\u201d\n\nNo Burning Man festival again this year because of the pandemic, organizers say.

Andy Barron/The Reno Gazette-Journal, via Associated Press Burning Man, the annual countercultural arts event that typically draws tens of thousands of people to Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert, has been canceled again this year because of the pandemic, but will return in 2022, organizers announced on Tuesday. The decision to forgo building the event\u2019s makeshift temporary metropolis, known as Black Rock City, in late August came after months of deliberations among organizers, who sought feedback from past participants on issues like vaccination requirements and racial diversity. With vaccinations mounting across the nation, expectations were high that the festival, which began in San Francisco in 1986 and moved to the Black Rock Desert in 1990, would resume this year after being called off in 2020. \u201cBut, although here in the United States we may be feeling the weight lifting and the light at the end of the tunnel brightening, we are still in the pandemic, and the uncertainties that need to be resolved are impossible to resolve in the time we have,\u201d organizers said on their website, The Burning Man Journal. The return of Burning Man \u2014 with its towering art installations, all-night dance parties under the stars, and desert-roaming vehicles shaped like Pac Man ghosts and fire-spewing sea creatures \u2014 had for many participants become a litmus test in the nation\u2019s collective journey back to some semblance of normalcy. Some groups of attendees who camped together at the event had already announced that they would not return in 2021 because of concerns about public health and about affordability, given the economic pain the pandemic has inflicted on many people. But many others were planning to attend, and certain camps were told as recently as Monday by organizers that they would be eligible for specific quantities of tickets, which only added to the sense of disappointment on Tuesday. Emily Nicolosi, a research assistant professor at the University of Utah who has attended Burning Man, said she had been working for months to build a collection of large sculptures for display at the event this year. \u201cI\u2019m pretty devastated,\u201d she said on Tuesday, though she noted that organizers have allowed artists to keep the grant money they received for art projects. Ms. Nicolosi said she did not fault the organizers for making the difficult decision to hold off until 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard choice, but I think they did the right thing to wait,\u201d she said.\n\nBrazil\u2019s health authority rejects importing Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine. A Sputnik V vaccine production line in Saint Petersburg, Russia in February. Credit... Emile Ducke for The New York Times RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Brazil\u2019s health authority said late Monday that it would not recommend importing Sputnik V, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia. The need for vaccines is urgent in Brazil: The country has been battered by one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks, driven by the highly contagious P. 1 virus variant. But the health authority, Anvisa, said that questions remained about the Russian vaccine\u2019s development, safety and manufacturing. All five of Anvisa\u2019s directors voted against importing the vaccine. Data about Sputnik V\u2019s efficacy was \u201cuncertain,\u201d Gustavo Mendes Lima Santos, Anvisa\u2019s manager of medicine and biological products, said in a lengthy late-night presentation. He noted that \u201ccrucial questions\u201d had gone unanswered, including those about potential adverse events. Russia is using Sputnik V in its own mass vaccination campaign, and the vaccine has been approved for emergency use in dozens of countries. A peer-reviewed study published in The Lancet in February said the vaccine had an efficacy rate of 91.6 percent. Brazil\u2019s decision prompted a response at the highest level of the Russian government, which has been energetically promoting Sputnik V in Latin America at a time when the United States has limited its vaccine exports to reserve doses for its own citizens. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said on Tuesday that the Russian government would try to win over the Brazilian regulators\u2019 minds about the vaccine\u2019s safety. \u201cContacts will continue,\u201d Mr. Peskov said on a conference call with journalists. \u201cIf data is missing, it will be provided. There should be no doubt in this.\u201d The official Sputnik V Twitter account have also pushed back, with a post in Portuguese on Monday saying that the vaccine\u2019s developers had shared \u201call the necessary information and documentation\u201d with Anvisa. In another tweet, it said Anvisa\u2019s decision \u201cwas of a political nature\u201d and had \u201cnothing to do with access to information or science.\u201d It alleged that the United States had persuaded Brazil to deny approval. Anvisa officials were under immense pressure to deliver a decision on Sputnik V, because Brazilian states had contracts to buy almost 30 million doses. The Supreme Court ordered Anvisa to make a decision. \u201cThe days of yes to the vaccine and to treatments are celebrated,\u201d Alex Machado, an Anvisa director, said. \u201cThere will inevitably be days of no.\u201d Gov. Camilo Santana of Cear\u00e1, one of the states with a Sputnik V contract, said on Twitter that he respected Anvisa\u2019s decision but found it strange, given that Sputnik V is being used in other countries. \u201cI will keep fighting for this authorization, in a safe manner, following all the rules,\u201d he said. The Gamaleya Research Institute, part of Russia\u2019s Ministry of Health, developed the vaccine, also known as Gam-Covid-Vac. The shot has been entangled in politics and propaganda, with President Vladimir V. Putin announcing its approval even before late-stage trials had begun. Ana Carolina Moreira Marino Ara\u00fajo, the general manager of the Anvisa department that inspects vaccine development, said at the meeting that Brazilian officials could not perform a full inspection of the Russian facilities. She said officials who were in Russia last week were denied access to the Gamaleya Institute and inspected only two factories, finding problems in one of them. She also said Russian officials had tried to cancel the agency\u2019s visit. \u201cAt this moment, the inherent risk in manufacturing couldn\u2019t be overcome,\u201d Ms. Ara\u00fajo concluded.

Walking near the Acropolis in Athens last month. Credit... Byron Smith for The New York Times Greece lifted quarantine requirements on Monday for arrivals from seven more countries, including Russia and Australia, continuing an easing of rules for foreign visitors before a formal reopening to tourists on May 15. Last week, Greece ended quarantine restrictions for visitors from European Union member states as well as the United States, Britain, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates. The steps were similar to those put in place in March for arrivals from Israel, which has been far ahead of most of the world in vaccinations. Greece is also stopping restrictions this week for visitors from New Zealand, South Korea, Thailand, Rwanda and Singapore. Greece had previously required arrivals to quarantine themselves for seven days. It is waiving that rule for passengers from the listed countries as long as they produce a vaccination certificate or the results of a negative PCR test conducted within 72 hours of their arrival. After heavy economic losses in 2020, the Greek authorities are determined to save this year\u2019s summer tourist season despite experiencing a severe third wave of coronavirus infections. Health officials have said the infection rate is stabilizing, though slowly. Greek health officials have reported more than 334,000 infections and more than 10,000 deaths from the virus, according to a New York Times database. A new concern is the appearance of the coronavirus variant that is believed to be fueling the worsening outbreak in India. On Sunday, health officials recorded the second case of that variant in Greece, found in a 33-year-old foreign woman who had traveled to Dubai in early April. Greece\u2019s high infection rate remains a worry for some governments. The U.S. State Department has advised against travel to Greece, citing a \u201cvery high level\u201d of coronavirus cases. Greek health officials have expanded testing in recent weeks as they gradually lift lockdown restrictions, with bars and restaurants scheduled to reopen on May 3 after a six-month hiatus. In other updates from around the world: With Thailand struggling to bring its worst coronavirus outbreak under control, Bangkok made it compulsory for residents to wear masks in public beginning on Monday. One of the first to break the new rule? The country\u2019s prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who was seen maskless at a government meeting in a photo published on his official Facebook page. As a first-time offender, he agreed to pay a fine of about $190.\n\nNew Zealand said it would allow quarantine-free travel from Western Australia to resume on Wednesday, after a three-day pause prompted by two coronavirus cases in the Australian city of Perth. Travelers who have been identified as contacts of the infected Australians \u2014 a man believed to have been infected in hotel quarantine, and a woman he later stayed with \u2014 will have to self-isolate and test negative for the virus before departure, according to New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins.\n\nThe authorities in Portugal said they might lift a state of emergency as early as the end of this month after reporting zero deaths from the virus on Monday. It was the first such day since August. The infection rate in Portugal has recently fallen to one of the lowest levels in Europe. Portugal\u2019s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, is giving a televised address on the subject Tuesday evening.\n\nAt first, getting the vaccine itself was the prize for older people in Russia seeking protection from the coronavirus. But with vaccinations slowing in Moscow, the city government began a program on Tuesday to encourage turnout with gift certificates. Residents over 60 will receive a voucher for 1,000 rubles, or about $13, redeemable at stores and restaurants. The Russian government has blamed widespread vaccine hesitancy for a slow start to its campaign. A shortage has also slowed the effort, with Russia exporting some of its doses. About 5 percent of Russians are now fully vaccinated; in the United States, it\u2019s 27 percent.

However, we would recommend that you wait a little more for the next-gen Classic 350. Its launch is due soon and it is based on the Meteor 350 platform, which is a huge improvement over the current Classic 350. The new platform has proven to be quite reliable so far, so running costs should be kept under check. The Classic 350 also commands decent resale value, so that should hold true for the next gen bike as well.\n\nTall order\n\nI want to purchase a bike that can deliver high performance, good efficiency, offers a comfortable highway performance and serves as a good city commuter.

So, what is it like?\n\nStarting with the engine, this 2.0-litre, four-cylinder petrol engine is a development of Merc\u2019s M260 unit, and it uses a twin-scroll turbocharger to boost torque at low speeds. Power is sent to all four wheels via Merc\u2019s own 7-speed dual-clutch automatic, and the four-wheel-drive system allows up to 50% of the power to be sent to the rear.\n\nThe A35 even gets uprated suspension components to help deal with the power better. Up front, it now gets the addition of a lower wishbone along with a custom strut brace used to enhance stiffness, and the shell of the car even gets underfloor stiffening. At the rear, AMG uses a new subframe to stiffen up the rear suspension mounting points.\n\nAll these upgrades certainly make a massive difference to the driving experience. The steering feels beautifully weighted, very direct and delivers a fair amount of connect. There is plenty of grip, the nose is keen to change direction and with the four tyres turning and clawing in, it even inspires confidence over wet patches.\n\nYou cannot really tell when the rear axle chips in, or if it does at all, but it does manage to feel quite neutral and balanced. The body control is very good, with the A35 feeling well poised even when you hurl it around.\n\nPlenty of energy\n\nProd the throttle and responses are immediate, sharp and wonderfully addictive; keep your foot in and the tacho needle climbs with plenty of energy. In fact, flatten the accelerator in second or third, with the engine spinning at around 3,000 rpm, and the A35 will leave you grinning.\n\nThrottle responses aren\u2019t as feral as the full blown V8, but this is still deeply addictive. Even flat-out performance is strong; we managed to record 0-100 kph in 5.6 sec without the use of launch control. The A35 is also a great tool for fast highway commutes; the stability is great, the brakes have a good amount of bite, and the twin-clutch gearbox works well.\n\nIn fact, the gearbox works particularly well when you are \u2018on it\u2019 \u2014 it shifts up crisply and it allows downshifts even when you are high up in the powerband. The gearbox, however, does pause and feel grabby at low speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe A35\u2019s adaptive AMG suspension also rounds off bumps on the road nicely, although larger bumps do catch it out occasionally; the short-travel suspension is not ideal.\n\nComing to the styling, Mercedes has given the A35 sedan flowing lines and spot-on proportions. On the inside, the A35 gets plenty of typical AMG touches \u2014 very supportive sports seats, a flat-bottomed steering wheel, aluminium sport pedals, and AMG-specific graphics for the digital instrument panel. What lifts the ambience considerably is the colour-matching ambient lighting in yellow.\n\nRear passengers also get a lot more space and comfort than the earlier CLA. Legroom is much improved, headroom is good for regular-sized passengers, and though you are seated a bit low, the rear seat isn\u2019t uncomfortable for two, even over long-ish journeys. The boot isn\u2019t too large at 420 litres, but it will carry a weekend\u2019s worth of bags quite easily or swallow three large suitcases.\n\nLaunched at \u20b956.24 lakh (ex-showroom, India), the locally assembled AMG A35 is clearly more expensive than the stock models, but then it delivers much more car as well. A lot more performance, sharper handling, a richer cabin, more kit and, not to be dismissed, the look of a higher-end AMG performance car.\n\nThe A35 isn\u2019t as exciting as a C63 and it won\u2019t be as practical on an everyday basis as something like a C-Class. Still, if you want the best of both worlds, the charming and fun-to-drive A35 certainly hits the spot."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/ahd5ue/article34429339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAC1534", "Article's Title": "TVS Apache RTR 160 4V assures greater fuel efficiency", "Article's Text": "TVS\u2019 Glide Through Technology, or GTT, makes it an easy motorcycle to ride in slow moving traffic too\n\nIt is almost as if TVS does not rest when it comes to rolling out little updates for its motorcycles, the Apache line-up in particular. In late 2019, the manufacturer introduced the facelifted iterations of the popular Apache RTR 160 4V and the RTR 200 4V. A few months ago, the latter got another, rather substantial, improvement; and now, it is the smaller 160\u2019s turn.\n\nAt the midst of it all\n\nFor starters, there is the updated engine. TVS has managed to churn out an additional 1.61 hp making it the most powerful engine in its class. Peak torque is impressive as well with 14.73 Nm produced at 7,250 rpm. Our performance tests showed that the Apache is also one of the quickest bikes in its segment.\n\nIt is outpaced to 60kph (by just 0.05sec) by its rival from Bajaj, but it is the quickest motorcycle to 100kph, getting there in 15.93sec. These numbers, combined with a smooth and free-revving engine, result in a rather sprightly motorcycle. It is only towards the very upper limit of the rev band that you can feel, and hear, vibrations from the foot pegs and the front end. The throttle response is crisp, too, and that improves the overall riding experience.\n\nAs was the case with the 2020 model, the 160 4V features TVS\u2019 Glide Through Technology, or GTT, making it a very easy motorcycle to ride in slow moving traffic. The GTT, essentially, works like the creep function in an automatic transmission equipped car, allowing the rider to keep moving without the need to feed any throttle. It is a natural feeling system that works in the first three gears, with each subsequent gear offering a slightly higher \u2018cruising\u2019 speed.\n\nSpeaking of cruising, the 160 4V will sit comfortably between 90-95 kph all day long, and while it can stay at a constant 115kph, it does feel a little stressed at those speeds. If you are a stickler for good fuel efficiency, this Apache will not disappoint. In our tests, the bike returned 43.24 kpl in the city and 50.76 kpl on the highway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn its toes\n\nThe RTR 160 4V has always been a capable and easy bike to ride fast. The bike uses a conventional telescopic fork and monoshock that offer a plush ride. This setup is also quite adept at going around corners very well, in a manner that feels intuitive. With the 2021 model, TVS also managed to shave off two kgs. While it is not a difference you will immediately notice, it does play a part.\n\nThe only downside to the comfort is the ergonomics. The Apache has a predominantly relaxed riding position, but the foot pegs are a little rear-set and sit high up. It is not something that will bother you over short distances, but if you are over 5ft 10in, this does feel a little cramped over longer stints.\n\nThe Apache RTR 160 4V is one of TVS\u2019 most popular motorcycles, and there is good reason to see why. It offers impressive performance, everyday practicality, and with prices starting at \u20b91.08 lakh, it is also great value for money.\n\nDespite being part of a heavily competitive segment, the RTR 160 4V remains one of the top contenders. Is it at the very top though? That is a question we hope to answer soon."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/obl1xn/article34413276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LMVH-Reutersjfif", "Article's Title": "Luxury brands use blockchain to promote product transparency", "Article's Text": "The companies will use blockchain to match product ID with client ID, enabling customers to access product history and authenticity by tracking manufacturing process right from raw materials stage to the point of sale\n\n(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories.

Women who have comorbidities are at more risk. In many cases, COVID affects the baby by reducing the amniotic fluid around the baby.Experts say the new strain is responsible for the increase in the number of COVID cases among pregnant women.

If the oxygen levels are fine and there are no comorbidities, there is no risk involved.- We all know prevention is better than cure, make sure to follow all the Covid safety protocols. Do not step out until necessary.- Keeping taking your vitamins and zinc along with a healthy diet and rest. Moderate exercise is also recommended.- If you test positive, do not panic and rush to the hospital. Most Covid cases can be managed at home with phone consultations with the doctor.- Do not self-medicate. Always talk to your doctor, even before taking any supplements.- Isolate yourself. Keep checking your temperature and oxygen levels every 6 hours.If your temperature does not subside even after taking paracetamol for four days and at any time your oxygen level goes below 94, you must talk to your doctor.

It\u2019s a disc-shaped tracking gadget that can be attached to items like house keys to help you find them.\n\nBut inside, the story gets far more interesting.\n\nThe AirTag, which Apple introduced last week, is one of the first consumer electronics to support a new wireless technology, ultrawideband, which lets you detect precise proximity between objects. Using ultrawideband, your iPhone can sense whether an AirTag is an inch or dozens of feet away from it. It\u2019s so accurate that its app will even show an arrow pointing you in the direction of the AirTag.\n\nThat\u2019s far better than other trackers that rely on Bluetooth, an older wireless technology that can only roughly guess an item\u2019s proximity. (More on how this all works later.)\n\nUsing ultrawideband to find lost items is just one early example of what the technology can do. Because of its pinpoint-precise ability to transfer data quickly between devices, ultrawideband could become the next wireless standard that succeeds Bluetooth. It could lead to better wireless earphones, keyboards, video game controllers \u2014 you name it."}, {"Article Image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A7A1/production/_118231924_supremecourt.jpg", "Article's Title": "Google data case to be heard in Supreme Court", "Article's Text": "It was the first-of-its-kind case in the UK.

Then the rover, its link to Earth, will head off to start its main mission of searching for signs of past life in a dried-up river delta along the rim of the crater.\n\nThe engineers lost a week diagnosing a problem that stopped the Ingenuity\u2019s computer from switching into \u201cflight mode.\u201d Adjusting the commands sent from Earth to Mars appears to have solved the problem.\n\nThe remaining flights are to further stretch Ingenuity to its limits. MiMi Aung, the project\u2019s manager, said on Monday she hoped the last one may travel as far as some 2,300 feet from its starting point.\n\nOther activities on Perseverance are also gearing up. NASA reported on Wednesday the success of an experiment on the rover called MOXIE in generating oxygen. The device broke apart carbon dioxide molecules in the Martian air. That advance will be crucial for future astronauts arriving from Earth \u2014 both to create something for them to breathe and to generate propellant for their return to Earth."}, {"Article Image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/25/multimedia/00XP-VACCINE-PROOF/00XP-VACCINE-PROOF-facebookJumbo.jpg", "Article's Title": "A Look at Covid-19 Vaccine \u2018Passports,\u2019 Passes and Apps Around the Globe", "Article's Text": "Isn\u2019t the European Union also developing a system? Yes. On June 21, the E.U. is expected to introduce a certificate called a Digital Green Pass, with the aim of allowing people who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus to travel more freely. Under the proposed rules, each nation within the bloc could decide which travel restrictions, such as obligatory quarantine, to waive for Digital Green holders. But many countries, including Denmark, say they cannot afford to wait for the Digital Green Pass and are developing their own versions.\n\nIsrael\n\nImage Israel\u2019s Green Pass app features a gif of a family headed on a trip. Credit... Isabel Kershner\n\nName of card: The Green Pass\n\nCould it get you an indoor table? Yes.\n\nHow about entry to a concert or sports game? That, too.\n\nAnything else? The pass allows you to enter many businesses, including swimming pools, gyms, theaters and wedding halls, as well as cultural events, such as concerts, sports games and religious gatherings. Having the pass may also mean that you may not have to quarantine for 10 to 14 days after international travel.\n\nHow does it work? In late February, Israel\u2019s ministry of health began offering the Green Pass to fully vaccinated residents and individuals who have recovered from Covid-19. When booking a table at a restaurant, many of the businesses began to ask, \u201cDo you have a Green Pass?\u201d Israelis can print their certificates containing a QR code, download the code onto their phones or flash the app itself.\n\nWhat\u2019s with that family? The app and other Green Pass materials feature an animated illustration of a family of three. The man is wearing shorts, a backpack and a camera around his neck, suggesting he\u2019s on vacation. His son and wife are wearing masks, but their postures are relaxed as they pull their suitcases.\n\nAparna Nair, a professor of science history at the University of Oklahoma who maintains a collection of vaccination certificates going back to the 1820s, said that this detail was noteworthy: \u201cThey are using the design of the vaccine passport to form visual connections with life after the pandemic, essentially, the vaccine as a literal passport to the rest of the world.\u201d"}, {"Article Image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-82287204,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49652,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "Article's Title": "Garmin Approach S12 GPS-enabled smartwatch launched at Rs 20,990", "Article's Text": "NEW DELHI: Garmin has expanded its smartwatch lineup in India with the launch of Garmin Approach S12 smartwatch.

Xiaomi sub-brand Poco also saw annual growth of 558%, with numbers being driven by value for money phones like the Poco M3 and the Poco X3 series phones.\n\nSamsung followed Xiaomi with a 20 per cent market share, with budget phones like the Galaxy M02 and Galaxy A32 becoming popular choices for buyers. Samsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S21 series phones also worked well for the brand in India, largely online through its own website.\n\nOther brands like Oppo, Vivo and Realme completed the top 5 brands in terms of market share.

It wouldn't be the first one titled so, as there was the hastened sequel to King Kong, the 1933 original that is considered by some as one of the greatest films of all time and essentially birthed the King Kong franchise. Wingard would be the first director of a MonsterVerse movie \u2014 the shared universe that includes Kong: Skull Island and the two most recent Godzilla movies \u2014 to return at the helm.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter brought word of Legendary Pictures \u201cquietly\u201d entertaining early talks with Wingard on a Godzilla vs. Kong sequel, as it plans out the future of MonsterVerse for \u201cone or more instalments.\u201d The sequel would be set in the (impossibly dumb but visually epic) Hollow Earth world that was introduced in Godzilla vs. Kong, which would allow the movie to bring in more varied creatures to the series. Wingard was reportedly instrumental in that world-building as well as crafting the giant monster action set-pieces for Godzilla vs. Kong, THR notes.\n\nBut there's no word on when we might see the Godzilla vs. Kong sequel, as Wingard is already caught up elsewhere. In February, it was reported that Paramount Pictures had hired Wingard to direct and co-write a sequel to John Woo's 1997 action film Face/Off with new actors in the lead roles. And then in March, Warner Bros. had said to have picked Wingard to make a live-action movie based off the animated ThunderCats franchise. It's unclear how and when Wingard would be able to accommodate a Godzilla vs. Kong sequel in that packed schedule.\n\nLegendary sticking with Wingard suggests the studio is pleased with what he delivered on Godzilla vs. Kong. On reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Godzilla vs. Kong is certified fresh at 75 percent, drawing from 348 critics reviews. The average rating is 6.4 out of 10. Godzilla vs. Kong has decidedly more mixed reviews on fellow reviews aggregator Metacritic, currently sitting at a score of 59 based on 57 reviews.

The light-hearted dog-themed cryptocurrency soared to an all-time high on April 16, when it touched $0.45 (Rs. 34 approximately). And as a result, the investor said, his initial investment had grown to almost $2 million (Rs. 15 crore approximately).\n\nExperts, however, have warned about the risks involved in investing in such digital currencies since the prices of these volatile assets can fall as sharply as they go up.

On April 15, he tweeted the photo of a 1926 painting \u2018Dog Barking At The Moon' by a Spanish artist and changed the title of the artwork \u2018Doge barking at the moon', referring to the cryptocurrency. That took the value of Dogecoin to all-time high.\n\nIn February, a series of tweets by Musk, hailing Dogecoin, took the value of the meme-based cryptocurrency to wild levels.

Unlike the UDID, the IDFA gives users more control over their privacy. Before the rollout of iOS 14.5, iPhone users were able to limit ad tracking but this new feature gives control over apps that want to track for advertising. Facebook, the social media giant, has a reason to worry as the new privacy feature for iOS could limit its ability to target ads to iPhone and iPad owners.\n\n\n\nExperts say the arrival of Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency feature will bring changes to how mobile advertisement works. In a press statement, Apple said its new privacy feature will require apps to get the user\u2019s permission before tracking their data across apps or websites owned by other companies for advertising or sharing their data with data brokers.\n\nThe rollout of iOS 14.5 is a big win for Apple, as the company has been long stressing the importance of user privacy amid its tussle with Facebook. Apple CEO Tim Cook earlier this year criticised Facebook\u2019s business model, attacking the Mark Zuckerberg-run company over its stance on user privacy. Cook, who runs the world\u2019s most successful tech company, has long emphasised that Apple is not in the business of selling data to advertisers.\n\nThe feature should be turned on automatically upon downloading the new iOS update.

In addition, the game also introduced two new T-shirt items inspired by Holi for players worldwide. It marked the first major India-specific in-game event by Pokemon Go. The company was also recently spotted hiring in India that may hint at the possibility of increasing its presence in the country.\n\nRecently, Pokemon Go developer Niantic shared a teaser image for its upcoming AR glasses. The reveal only showed a part of the AR glasses and not how they will function. The image only shows the temples of the glasses along with a strap that features the Niantic logo in orange colour. The temples seem thick and appear to house a tiny speaker grille.

Ironheart focusses on genius inventor Riri Williams \u2014 she will be played by Dominique Thorne (If Beale Street Could Talk) \u2014 who designs the most advanced suit of armour since Iron Man. All signs point to Marvel setting up Thorne's Ironheart/ Riri Williams (Thorne) to take over from Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man / Tony Stark in the MCU, who died towards the end of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nVariety first brought word of Hodge's hiring on Ironheart, with both Marvel Studios and Hodge's representatives refusing comment. She has previously worked as a staff writer on the TNT post-apocalyptic dystopian thriller series Snowpiercer (available on Netflix in India and elsewhere), and executive story editor on the Apple TV+ reboot of anthology series Amazing Stories. Hodge is also a poet and playwright, having published two poetry books.\n\nCreated by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Mike Deodato, Riri Williams entered the Marvel comics universe in 2016 as a 15-year-old MIT student who reverse engineers Iron Man's armour to create one of her own. In the MCU, Stark is a MIT graduate \u2014 and early in Captain America: Civil War, he had visited his alma mater to demonstrate the holographic tech B.A.R.F. (Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing) that was designed by Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), the villain in Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nAt MIT then, Stark also unveiled a September Foundation grant that funded the projects of every MIT student gathered. Maybe Riri Williams will turn out to be one among them? Of course, this is just pure speculation on my part. Marvel doesn't always retain the origin stories from comic books as is, so there's no guarantee that Riri Williams will be a MIT student in the Ironheart MCU Disney+ series as well. We'll have to wait until next year at the least to find out.\n\nBefore Ironheart, on TV, we will see the Tom Hiddleston-led Loki (debuting June 11), followed by Iman Vellani-starrer Ms. Marvel and Hawkeye with Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld (both late 2021). For 2022 so far, we've Oscar Issac-led Moon Knight, Mark Ruffalo and Tatiana Maslany in She-Hulk, and a Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special. Then in the undated section, there's Secret Invasion with Samuel L. Jackson, Olivia Colman, and Emilia Clarke, the Don Cheadle-led Armor Wars, a Wakanda series from Ryan Coogler, and a Hawkeye spin-off centred on Echo.\n\nIronheart is expected in 2022 on Disney+ and Disney+ Hotstar. It will reportedly run for six episodes in total. A writers' room will be assembled starting in May, says The Hollywood Reporter."}, {"Article Image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/poco_f3_gt_redmi_k40_game_enhanced_edition_1619612941034.jpg", "Article's Title": "Poco F3 GT India Launch Tipped, Could Be Rebranded Redmi K40 Game Enhanced Edition", "Article's Text": "Poco F3 GT may be launched in India as the rebranded Redmi K40 Game Enhanced Edition that made its debut in China yesterday.

This will be the phase 3 of the vaccination drive in India that will expand the existing criteria of vaccinating people aged 45 and above. Registration for the COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory and it requires eligible people to have a valid Indian identity proof such as a PAN card or other government ID. India last reported over 350,000 cases in a day, the highest in the world.\n\nThe government will kick off the registration process for the people aged between 18 and 44 years at 4pm through the CoWIN portal, as well as the Aarogya Setu and Umang apps, the official MyGovIndia account tweeted on Wednesday. The registration was initially announced to go live from midnight (12am), but it was postponed to 4pm. At the time of writing, the official Aarogya Setu account tweeted that although registration for the CoWIN portal is now open, scheduling vaccination sessions is to be set up by the state governments and private vaccination centres, so it might take a little more time before you can actually make an appointment.\n\nFollowing the registration, the vaccination drive for all the eligible people will begin from May 1. It will, however, be subject to the availability of the vaccines. Appointments at state government centres and private centres will depend on how many vaccination centres are ready on May 1 for vaccination of the people aged above 18, the MyGovIndia account tweeted.\n\nHow to register for the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nOnline registration for COVID-19 vaccination is mandatory for people aged between 18 and 44 years, according to the FAQ section on the CoWIN portal. This means that unlike the people aged 45 years and above, people between the ages of 18 and 44 years are not likely to be eligible for an on-spot registration (walk-in appointment).\n\nYou need to have a mobile number to register for the COVID-19 vaccination online. The government also requires a valid Indian ID proof. This can be your Aadhaar card, driving licence, PAN card, passport, pension passbook, NPR smart card, or voter ID card (e-elector photo identity card). As mentioned, you can register on the CoWIN portal, or through Aarogya Setu or Umang app.\n\nSteps to register for COVID-19 vaccination through CoWIN portal Once COVID-19 vaccine registration for people aged 18-44 years begins, eligible citizens will be able to register for an appointment online. Here's how you can do that. Twitter to Ease COVID-19 Resource Searches in India With These Updates Register/ Sign in Yourself. Visit CoWIN website and click on Type your mobile number and hit the Get OTP button. A one-time password (OTP) will reach your phone. Enter the OTP you have received on your phone and click Verify. Now, enter details such as your name, gender, and year of birth. Click on Register. Click on Schedule next to the name of the person registered to book the appointment for the vaccination. Enter your pin code and click Search. You will see the centres available for your pin code. You can also search for a vaccine centre by selecting your state and district. Select the centre and date and time for the vaccination, and hit Confirm.\n\nYou can add up to four family members through one registration. However, it is important to point out that if one person aged 45 years or above and others aged between 18 and 44 years want to schedule a combined appointment, then only private paid vaccination centres or vaccination centres as per state government's policy will be made available.\n\nSteps to register for COVID-19 vaccine via Aarogya Setu app\n\nIf you do not want to use the CoWIN portal via a Web browser, you can use the Aarogya Setu app on your phone to register for the COVID-19 vaccine. Below are the steps that you can follow to register using the app.\n\nOpen the Aarogya Setu app. Go to the CoWIN tab from the home screen. Select Vaccination Registration and enter your phone number to get an OTP. Tap Verify. You will be directed to the Registration of Vaccination page. Now follow the same steps as mentioned above for registering through the CoWIN portal.\n\nThe vaccination drive currently includes two COVID-19 vaccines, namely Covaxin that has been developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and Covishield that has been developed by the Oxford-AstraZeneca and is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII)."}, {"Article Image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/galaxy_a41_m01_main_1619612194944.jpg", "Article's Title": "Samsung Galaxy A41, Galaxy M01 Getting Android 11-Based One UI 3.1 Update: Reports", "Article's Text": "Samsung Galaxy A41 and Galaxy M01 are reportedly receiving Android 11-based One UI 3.1 update.

Although not quite as well known as options from brands such as Realme and Redmi, the Nokia audio range includes some useful and well-equipped products. One of the company's recent launches is the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite, an affordable pair of true wireless earphones priced at Rs. 3,599 that promises a lot at a very reasonable price.\n\nThe Nokia Power Earbuds Lite may seem like an ordinary and basic pair of true wireless earphones at first glance, but IPX7 water resistance and a promise of good battery life make this an interesting option at the price. Is this the best pair of true wireless earphones you can buy for less than Rs. 4,000? Find out in this review.\n\nTouch controls on the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite\n\nWhile more sophisticated features and design can be expected on high-end true wireless headsets, the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite sticks to the basics given its price of Rs. 3,599. The earpieces have a stalk-less design, and are therefore a fair bit larger at the top than our current top pick in the budget true wireless segment, the OnePlus Buds Z.\n\nThe earphones have a proper in-ear fit, but all three of the included pairs of ear tips are too small and don't have as tight a seal as those of the OnePlus Buds Z and JVC HA-A10T. This wasn't uncomfortable for me, but the inner parts of the earpieces are a fair bit thicker than on most other earphones to make up for the reduction in noise isolation from the tips, and this large inner size did feel a bit too snug at times.\n\nThe Nokia Power Earbuds Lite have a stalk-less design, which makes the earpieces quite large\n\nWhile not exceptionally good-looking or stylish, the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite have the Nokia aesthetic of functional and sensible design down well. There are big Nokia logos, indicator lights which shine through a transparent section, and microphones at the bottom of each earpiece.\n\nThere are touch controls, with the entire outer surface (the area surrounding the Nokia logos) of each unit being a sensitive zone for taps. A single tap on either side plays or pauses music or answers calls, a double tap on the left or right decreases or increases the volume respectively, and a triple tap on the left or right skips to the previous or next track respectively. The controls are easy enough to learn and use, and I found it particularly useful to have volume controls on the headset itself.\n\nThe charging case on my review unit was matte black, somewhat complementing the glossy black of the earpieces. The front of the case has a Nokia logo, while the back has a USB Type-C cable for charging. Just under the lid are four indicator lights for the battery level of the case, which illuminate when the earpieces are placed inside. The earpieces latch onto the case magnetically, and the lid also shuts similarly.\n\nFor connectivity, the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite use Bluetooth 5, with support for only the SBC Bluetooth codec; the lack of support for even AAC is disappointing. The earpieces are powered by 6mm dynamic drivers. They are also IPX7 rated for water resistance, which is one of the headset's most impressive specifications. The earpieces are rated to handle significant exposure to water including being submerged completely for a short time, making them suitable for use outdoors and while working out.\n\nThe Nokia Power Earbuds Lite ran for around four hours per charge of the earpieces, while the case added six extra charges\n\nBattery life on the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite is decent for a headset in this price range, with the earpieces running for around 4 hours on a single charge and the charging case providing nearly six additional charges. This made for a total listening time of around 28 hours per charge cycle, which isn't very commonly seen on true wireless headsets priced at under Rs. 5,000.\n\nClean, enjoyable sound on the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite\n\nThe budget true wireless segment tends to be a hit or miss; either sound quality is very good for the price, or the exact opposite. The Nokia Power Earbuds Lite fortunately fit in the former category, with clean and well-tuned sound across genres. Interestingly, the earphones do a decent job even with only the basic SBC Bluetooth codec, proving that good tuning and drivers make a big difference to the sound.\n\nPerhaps the best way for a pair of budget headphones or earphones to succeed is to take no risks, and that's exactly what the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite manages to achieve. The sonic signature isn't very different from those of other options in this price segment, sitting somewhere between the bass-friendly sound of the OnePlus Buds Z and the more neutral, detailed sound of the JVC HA-A10T. The Nokia earphones seem to strike the right balance between these signatures, offering a reasonable amount of drive and attack, without sacrificing too much on the mid-range and detail.\n\nThe ear tips of the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite are small, and don't offer a very tight fit in the ear canal\n\nListening to a live version of Strandbar by Todd Terje, there was excellent interplay between the lows and highs, with the percussion feeling tight and rightfully dominating the feel of this fast, exciting track. The highs were just sharp enough as well, while the detail in the mid-range managed to push through capably.\n\nThere was a bit of everything in the sound when listening to this engaging track, with the earphones even managing to capture the feel of the audience clapping and cheering for this excellent live performance. While its sound certainly wasn't as detailed or driven as what the slightly more expensive Lypertek Levi can achieve, the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite reproduces enough in the sound to more than completely justify its price, and then some.\n\nA listen to my favourite test track right now, Jaago by Lifafa, confirmed that despite leaning a bit towards the mid range and offering a fair amount of detail, this pair of earphones does focus on the lows, and offers perhaps the most detailed and calculated bass I've heard on any true wireless earphones priced under Rs. 4,000. The first half of this track did let Suryakant Sawhney's soulful vocals push through cleanly, but the earphones truly came into their element when the punchy bass kicked off in the second half.\n\nAcross genres, the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite sounded clean, consistent, fun, and impressive for the price. Perhaps the only thing missing in the sound is that almost indescribable edge \u2013 those small moments where you hear something new, or differently \u2013 which I only tend to hear on premium options. Objectively, this Nokia headset is just about everything you can expect from a pair of earphones priced under Rs. 4,000.\n\nI also used the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite for occasional calls, and it worked decently, with clear sound and reasonable microphone performance in quiet environments. Connectivity was good indoors, with the earphones maintaining a stable connection over distances of up to 10 feet from the paired smartphone.\n\nVerdict\n\nWhen you're shopping for high-end headphones and earphones, features and exceptional sound quality matter a lot. However, when you're looking for good affordable options, getting the basics right consistently is the key. That's exactly what the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite offers; this is an uncomplicated, capable pair of true wireless earphones that works as it's supposed to, and gives you very little reason to complain.\n\nYou might alternatively want to consider the OnePlus Buds Z for its better feature set, but the sound is a bit more detailed and calculated on the Nokia Power Earbuds Lite. It's among the best pairs of earphones you can buy for under Rs. 4,000. However, if you can spend just a bit more \u2013 up to Rs. 5,000 \u2013 then that will open up some impressive options to you, such as the Oppo Enco W51 and Lypertek Levi.\n\nIs Android One holding back Nokia smartphones in India?

Though 22 years have passed since the original's release on N64, the fundamentals of the game haven't changed much. You're inside a capsule vehicle that treks along a fixed path, you throw fruit, zoom in with a snazzy camera and take photos of Pokemon for a professor to evaluate.\n\nLike many gamers who intend to buy New Pokemon Snap on Friday, I played the original on the N64. My heart was excited for New Pokemon Snap, but my brain was weary. I had it all wrong. New Pokemon Snap is a reinvigorating vacation for your brain, one that works because it's so full of heart. Remind you of anything?\n\nDespite being a sequel, New Pokemon Snap reminded me of a completely different game: Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons was released around the same time last year on the Nintendo Switch. Like Animal Crossing, the appeal of New Pokemon Snap cannot be explained with words alone. Like Animal Crossing, New Pokemon Snap is more satisfying than it should be.\n\nLike Animal Crossing, New Pokemon Snap is just nice.\n\nSince its announcement last June, New Pokemon Snap has been subject to consternation among Pokemon fans. In 2021 the Pokemon Snap concept, viable as a full-priced game in 1999, feels like it would be more appropriate as a free-to-play iOS/Android title. How would developers Namco Bandai pad the game out enough to make it feel substantial, without stretching the concept thin?\n\nEnlarge Image Pokemon Company\n\nSnap 'em all\n\nNew Pokemon Snap is not a complicated game.\n\nYour vehicle's movement is fixed, so your only job is to look around and take photos. At the beginning Professor Mirror -- for there is always a Pokemon professor -- gives you a Photodex, which you'll fill by taking photos of Pokemon. Mirror will evaluate your photos at the end of each level, giving you points based on factors like how large the Pokemon is and how centrally it's focused.\n\nThe Photodex categorizes shots on a four-star scale. Each star represents different action: A photo of Pikachu sitting quietly may be one star, eating fruit may be two stars, letting off a thunderbolt three stars, playing with a Pokemon friend four stars. Different actions, different star rankings. To that end, you're given a variety of tools -- throwable fruit, lumination orbs, a scanner and a music box -- to capture Pokemon in different actions and from different angles.\n\nAll of this tomfoolery is just a pretext to get you paying attention to details. And it mostly works well: Replaying the same levels looking for different angles of the same Pokemon or trying to elicit different reactions has an addictive quality.\n\nEnlarge Image Nintendo\n\nNintendo\n\nThat brings us to the real MVP of New Pokemon Snap: level design. It's fantastic. Each stage is an intricately designed set piece. It's not just that the game is often beautiful, it's also effective at guiding your attention. Big, irresistible Pokemon shepherd your gaze from one area to the next, but the screen is often filled with multiple moments worthy of capture. On your third or fourth playthrough of a level, you'll find that the same Pokemon you gawked at the first few times was merely a diversion and that an even better shot was to the side or behind you the whole time.\n\nTo keep gameplay fresh, the level designs often change. All the points Professor Mirror gives you for capturing shots count toward leveling up each stage, and each new level-up brings new elements. That can be new Pokemon, the same Pokemon behaving differently or slightly different routes opening up. These changes sound small but, like changing the piece shapes on the same puzzle set, drastically change strategy.\n\nIt's not flawless. Systems don't work perfectly, particularly the algorithms that determine points and star categories. The star rankings are specific to each Pokemon, so I often found what would be two-star activity for one species would be ranked differently for another. What's more, I'd take several photos of the same Pokemon within the space of a second or two only to find that nearly identical shots would fall into different star categories. Meanwhile, the points system prioritizes the size of the Pokemon in the shot. That results in you getting more points for boring closeups than for fun shots taken from a slight distance: Sometimes it feels like your creativity is being stifled by the man -- Professor Mirror, in this case. But these are technical imperfections that cause minor annoyance, not major frustration.\n\nEnlarge Image Nintendo\n\nDaily getaway\n\nThere are two types of Pokemon fan: Those who religiously play every mainline title, and those who only remember the original 151. Those in the former group probably already have plans to play New Pokemon Snap this weekend, but less hardcore fans shouldn't write off New Pokemon Snap.\n\nMake no mistake, the game is principally fan service. There's a satisfying, daydream quality to seeing your favorite Pokemon eat, sleep and just generally vibe in the idyllic worlds within New Pokemon Snap. But you don't need to be able to list all 893 Pokemon to enjoy that. You don't really even need to have played a Pokemon game to enjoy it. New Pokemon Snap is like a safari adventure, a getaway that you can dive into for 20 minutes at a time.\n\nBut though it can be enjoyed in bites, I was perhaps most surprised at just how substantial New Pokemon Snap is. Thanks to outstanding level design and a deluge of Pokemon to capture, Namco Bandai has succeeded in making New Pokemon Snap charming for the dozen-hour duration of the main story. Even better, having seen the credits I have the feeling I've snapped only a fraction of everything there is to snap. In an era of 50-hour-long open-world RPGs, it shows that more isn't always more.\n\nNew Pokemon Snap is a relaxing game about photographing anime creatures. It's not epic, and it's not trying to be a landmark moment in gaming, but it keeps you smiling. Last year, Animal Crossing proved that can be more than enough."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/Fim8rV6GJdXJMPg6xGKgDUMx5q8=/1200x630/2020/05/19/7fe102f2-53fc-475c-9313-f55c3c4cf0f6/img-0231.jpg", "Article's Title": "Spotify climbs to 356 million listeners, with 158 million paid members", "Article's Text": "Erin Carson/CNET\n\nSpotify's total number of users climbed 24% to 356 million in the first three months of the year, the music streaming service said Wednesday.

March's stimulus bill was just the first leg of a three-part plan by Biden to create jobs, reduce poverty and get more money into people's hands to drive the US economy as it emerges from the pandemic this year. The first piece of Biden's plan -- the American Rescue Plan -- start with the one-time stimulus checks for up to $1,400 a piece and runs through seven child tax credit payments and monthly $300 checks to fill in for lost wages for unemployed workers. The next two more stimulus proposals for 2021 would send more money directly to people and work to let individuals and families hold on to the money they already have.\n\nThe next the package up -- which Biden is calling the American Jobs Plan -- if approved would put more than $2 trillion into the US economy and create jobs through focusing on critical infrastructure. The second, called the American Families Plan, according to the Washington Post, could set aside $1 trillion for individuals and families.\n\nRight now, the plans are just that, but we'll be following its development. We'll share every benefit we know so far. Plus, here's what to expect from the enhanced child tax credit, what is happening with canceling student debt, how to claim money your state has of yours and how March's stimulus bill can help you save money on health care costs.\n\nWhen would Biden's American Families Plan bill arrive?\n\nThe American Families Plan is still months from approval. First, Biden and Congress are crafting the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion plan to build and upgrade roads and transportation hubs, improve the power grid, fund EV car charging, expand affordable housing and bring high-speed broadband to more rural areas.\n\nAs far as we know, the American Jobs Plan wouldn't include a fourth check or other obvious savings. It's the bill after that -- the American Families Plan -- that could come closer. Keep reading for ways Biden and Congress plans to directly help you with the third stimulus bill, plus other proposals on the table.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nHow Biden's American Families Plan bill could benefit you\n\nAfter the Biden administration completes its infrastructure and jobs plan, it would move on to seek $1 trillion spending and $500 billion in new tax credits, according to the Washington Post, for the third stimulus package. Here are some of the main areas the American Families Plan could cover:\n\nExtend the expanded child tax credit through 2025: The temporary expansion of the child tax credit in March's stimulus bill is expected to reduce child poverty by 45%, according to Columbia University's Center on Poverty and Social Policy, and lift nearly 5 million children out of poverty entirely. The short-term expansion of the program is set to expire this year however, unless Congress renews the program. Biden's plan would extend the expanded child credit to 2025, the Post reports.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Child tax credit: How much are you getting?\n\nTwo years of tuition-free community college: As a presidential candidate, Biden said he would work to make the first two years of college free. Biden's plan would cover the first two years of community college, including for adults and new high school graduates. Training programs outside of community colleges would also qualify. Students would still be responsible for some expenses, like textbooks.\n\nFree prekindergarten instruction: For another campaign pledge, the American Families Plan is expected to propose free pre-K education for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\nMore affordable child care: Biden during his campaign said he would work to make child care more affordable for working families through tax credits and subsidies for child care costs. His new plan is expected to embrace that campaign plan for child care.\n\nPaid family and medical leave: Biden is expected to propose broader support for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nHow else could Washington send money to you?\n\nDetails of the second and third pieces of Biden's stimulus plans are still being worked out, but other proposals are already under discussion that could either let you hold on to more of your money or send you new payments.\n\nStudent loan forgiveness of $10,000 or $50,000: With student loan debt reaching $1.7 trillion at the end of 2020 -- for an average loan amount of $30,000 -- student debt is higher than auto loans and credit cards, according to nonpartisan think tank Brookings Institution. Biden has proposed canceling $10,000 in debt per student and has directed Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to explore if he has the authority to cancel student debt.\n\nSend a fourth stimulus check -- or checks: The IRS is still making one-time payments for the third stimulus check as well as circling back for those who it either missed paying or underestimated their payments.

The new Type S models get a 355-horsepower turbocharged V6, more aggressive styling and a bunch of other performance upgrades. But before we look at what's ahead, it's important to talk about where we've been. And for that, Acura invited me up to the mountains north of Los Angeles to take a spin in a handful of performance cars from its heritage collection.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\n2001 Acura 3.2CL Type S\n\nThe 3.2CL launched Acura's Type S sub-brand when it debuted in 2001. It's got a 3.2-liter V6 engine sending 260 hp and 232 pound-feet of torque through the front wheels, up from the normal CL's 225 hp. You could get a six-speed manual transmission in the CL's final model year, but this example has the standard five-speed automatic. Other Type S upgrades included perforated leather seats, larger 17-inch wheels, firmer springs and a quicker steering rack.\n\nThis particular CL has just over 720 miles on it and it's strange to be driving a two-decade-old car that is literally showroom fresh. It still looks great, with three-box proportions that you don't see on new coupes anymore, a squat stance with rounded fender flares and even dual exhaust tips. The interior has some modern features that I wasn't expecting to see, like climate controls in the nav screen, and everything is well built and feels premium. That tall greenhouse and thin pillars means the CL has fantastic visibility, too.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\nThe CL's V6 is awesome. It really comes alive above 5,000 rpm -- thanks, VTEC -- and has an excellent roar. The 3.2CL feels quick even by modern standards. The transmission has a manual mode that you shift with the gear selector, allowing me to keep the car in second and third pretty much the whole time. Every CL Type S came with large disc brakes with ABS and the pedal is satisfyingly firm.\n\nEven better is how the CL handles. The steering is linear and direct, lightening up and speed and not requiring a lot of tiny adjustments, plus it offers a lot of feedback. There's almost no understeer or torque steer, even when flooring it coming out of a corner. The suspension is a little floaty and there's a lot of body roll, but the CL is damn fun to throw into a corner and you can really feel the weight transfer. I wish more new cars were like the CL; there's really nothing else like it today.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\n2007 Acura TL Type S\n\nRather than going chronologically, I decided to grab the car I was most excited about: the second-gen TL Type S. I've loved this generation of TL ever since it was first shown in 2003 and the design has held up extremely well. The Type S debuted a few years later with unique fascias and other sporty details like awesome 10-spoke wheels and quad exhaust tips, with an interior that still looks modern today. I especially love the supportive bucket seats and cool gauges. This TL has about 48,000 miles and, aside from a couple minor cosmetic problems, it doesn't feel its age.\n\nWhile the standard TL has a 3.2-liter V6 with 258 hp and 233 lb-ft, the Type S bumps that up to a 3.5-liter V6 with 286 hp and 256 lb-ft. Peak torque comes on at 5,000 rpm while peak horsepower is at 6,200 rpm and the TL will happily rev up to 7,000. The TL's V6 sounds noisier and rowdier than the CL's, and the car feels even quicker. Acura offered the Type S with a six-speed manual but, like the CL, this one has the five-speed auto, which has great paddle shifters but can be slow to downshift.\n\nCompared to the CL, the TL is a lot sharper. The suspension is way more planted, the steering is quicker and its Brembo brakes are stronger. While there's a bit of understeer and tire squeal, the TL has a lot more grip than you think, even despite the all-season tires. Push the TL harder and it scrambles to redline with some hilarious torque steer, but it's never uncontrollable. The TL Type S drives how I wish more modern family sedans would.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\n2006 Acura RSX Type S\n\nAcura launched the RSX hatchback in 2001 with the Type S arriving a year later. It's got a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine making 200 hp -- 40 hp more than the standard RSX -- and a glorious 8,100-rpm redline. That engine is paired exclusively with a six-speed manual transmission, one cog more than in the normal RSX. This particular RSX is a later facelift model, which has an additional 10 hp and a sweet rear wing. The Type S also has firmer suspension, larger front brakes and perforated leather seats.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of driving the RSX I'm giggling my butt off. It's got one of the best manual transmissions I've ever used, with super-short pedal travel and a slick, short-throw shifter with great mechanical action. Max power occurs at an absurd 7,800 rpm and the engine gets better the higher you rev, but crucially, despite its maximum 140 lb-ft not coming on until 7,000 rpm, the RSX has enough low-end push to not feel sluggish at lower speeds or in a higher gear. It also sounds fantastically buzzy and is loud as hell by the time you reach redline.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\nThe RSX's steering is incredible, the right balance of heavy and quick with a ton of feedback and the steering wheel itself is fantastic and small. There's a ton of grip and no understeer or torque steer -- I know this is clich\u00e9, but it really does feel like a go-kart. The driving position is excellent -- as is the visibility -- and the whole interior is well laid out and usable. I love that it's a hatchback and there's even a good amount of space for rear passengers.\n\nThe RSX is a car I wish I could keep driving all day. It's fizzy, energetic and fun no matter the situation. Best of all, like in a Mazda Miata or other modern hot hatchback, even when hitting redline and running up through fourth gear, the RSX is slow enough to be usable on public roads. While I enjoy every one of these Acuras, the RSX is the one that has me checking Craigslist to potentially buy my own.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\n2001 Acura Integra Type R\n\nWhile it's not a Type S, the Integra Type R is probably Acura's most iconic performance car (NSX aside). I decided to save the best for last and waiting to go out in the Integra until the end of the day was totally worth it. This particular Type R is the same one my colleagues drove a few months ago and it's perfect. Totally stock and with just over 5,500 miles on the odometer, it's one of the most pristine Type Rs on the planet, the kind of car that could easily surpass the $50K mark at auction.\n\nEven though the Integra overlapped with the RSX, getting into the Type R after driving the RSX is like jumping back in time. The interior is extremely simple and stark, with almost no creature comforts aside from the radio and air conditioning. It's got super thin pillars and nowhere to rest your arms or knees. While the RSX feels like just a fun road car, the Integra feels like a race car -- especially once you start it up.\n\nIts 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine makes a meager 195 hp and 130 lb-ft, but it revs to a stratospheric 8,500 rpm. The engine is always loud, but when VTEC kicks in at 5,700 rpm it turns into a blare that fills and shakes the whole cabin. Accelerating in second and third gear is an adrenaline rush and the close-together pedals and short-throw shifter make for satisfying gear changes.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\nThe Integra is a lot feistier in corners than the RSX, too, helped by the fact that it weighs a scant 2,600 pounds. It hops and skips over bumps but never gets unsettled and I can feel every imperfection in the road through the floor and the steering wheel. Its steering requires a lot more focus and small corrections, but it's absolutely perfect and a joy to use. There's a seemingly endless amount of grip and it's easy to push the Type R to go faster in corners. The most surprising thing about the Integra is the lift-off oversteer, which is slightly terrifying at first but enjoyable once I'm used to it.\n\nGolden-era Hondas were never my obsession as a kid, but I've always had an interest and an affection for them -- especially as someone who played the hell out of Gran Turismo. And while the Integra Type R never held the legendary status in my head that it did for so many other enthusiasts, I understood why it was so hyped up. But now that I've been able to experience the car for myself, I'm basically ready to get a red Honda logo tattooed on my lower back. The Integra Type R really is that good.\n\nEnlarge Image Daniel Golson/Roadshow\n\n2022 Acura MDX A-Spec\n\nAcura brought a 2022 TLX Type S for display, but I can't drive it for a few more months. Instead, I had the choice to drive a TLX A-Spec or MDX A-Spec and the redesigned crossover was the easy choice. Let's be real, as cool as the TLX is, no one really cares about sedans in the US. The MDX sells at almost triple the volume of the TLX, so it's Acura's best hope at the Type S revival being a success.\n\nThe A-Spec package doesn't add much in terms of performance upgrades, but it does get you 20-inch wheels and front seats with better bolstering. Good news is, the MDX is inherently pretty great to drive. It feels its size but is shockingly nimble in corners, with direct steering and a well damped suspension. The optional Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive system is fantastic; it can send up to 70% of torque to the rear wheels and 100% of that torque from side to side.\n\nIt's obvious the MDX's chassis and brakes can handle a lot more power than the 290 hp put out by its naturally aspirated V6 and the Type S' stickier tires and other upgrades should do wonders, as well. Plus, the MDX already looks great and has a phenomenal interior -- annoying touchpad infotainment aside -- and it's got tons of passenger and cargo room to boot.\n\nIt's clear that there are true enthusiasts working at Acura -- from designers and engineers to product planners and marketers -- and trotting out these awesome older models for me to drive makes the brand's performance aspirations seem legit. If the new Type S cars can capture even some of the goodness of Acura's past hits, we could be looking at a couple of real winners."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/QQOsQZX0cKbtC4oZyz4bLw6kLy4=/1200x630/2020/01/10/968b56f5-6f03-48f3-9902-e106c60baf61/ces-2020-cea-logo.jpg", "Article's Title": "CES 2022 will return to Las Vegas in person", "Article's Text": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nCES 2022 is going back to Las Vegas following this year's all-digital event, the Consumer Technology Association said Thursday, as coronavirus restrictions ease in the US.

But that's not stopping us from looking ahead to the next new version of the iPhone operating system: iOS 15. As usual, we'll expect a range of new features in iOS 15, building on iOS 14's upgrades such as home-screen widgets and new camera tricks. We've also got a pretty good idea of when to expect the new OS to be released.\n\nHere's every rumor about iOS 15 we've heard so far and every educated guess we can make, including when it may be available to download, and what new features we may see.\n\nRead more: WatchOS 7.4: Best new Apple Watch features to try\n\nNow playing: Watch this: iPhone 13 rumor roundup\n\niOS 15 release date: September is likely\n\nApple typically reveals new versions of iOS at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Last year's virtual WWDC started on June 22, and we got our first look at iOS 14, iPadOS 14 and MacOS Big Sur. This year, WWDC 2021 will again be all virtual, and will take place June 7-11.\n\nAfter the new iOS is announced, it becomes available to developers for testing and, usually later in the summer, as a public beta.\n\nThe final version of iOS 15 is likely to launch in September, alongside the iPhone 13. Even though last year, the iPhone 12's release was delayed to October due to the pandemic, we still saw iOS 14 released in September. So it's a pretty good bet that iOS 15 will follow the same schedule.\n\nDevice compatibility: iOS 15 will probably work on iPhone 7 and later\n\nThe only rumor we've heard about device compatibility so far is that iOS 15 will require an iPhone 7 or later, according to Israeli site The Verifier and French site iPhoneSoft. That's not a huge surprise, since the iPhone 6 models are now more than five years old, and run on the A9 chip. It seems that iOS 15 will require devices with an A10 chip, which include the iPhone 7 and beyond, and the seventh-gen iPod Touch.\n\nRead more: iOS 14 hidden features: 13 awesome iPhone and iPad tricks we found\n\nNew iOS 15 features: Upgrades to notifications and autoreply, changing default apps, making widgets interactive\n\nGIF by Jason Cipriani/CNET\n\nWe won't have a good idea of what features are actually coming to iOS 15 until it's actually unveiled at WWDC 2021. Since iOS 14 was a large update, it's possible that iOS 15 will make fewer changes, and instead build on the base iOS 14 set up and improve its functionality.\n\nAn April 22 report from Bloomberg said that iOS 15 will include upgrades to notifications, new device privacy protections, an updated lock screen and a redesigned iPad home screen with widgets. Users will be able to set different notification preferences depending on their current status (for example, driving, working or sleeping), and have the option to set automatic replies for each situation, according to the report. Apple is also working on changes to iMessage, with the goal of turning it into more of a WhatsApp competitor, though that may come later, the report said.\n\nAccording a March report from the tech site PhoneArena, iOS 15 could allow you to change more default apps. In iOS 14, you were able to swap defaults Safari and Mail for other browser and email apps. The upcoming iOS 14.5 update will also let you change your default music platform from Apple Music. iOS 15 may allow you to make more customizations like this.\n\nPhoneArena also predicts that iOS 15 will make widgets interactive, the way they are on Android, which would let you do things like change volume or toggle things on and off. We may also see more widget size options, the site reported.\n\nThe iPhone 13 is rumored to have an always-on display, similar to the Apple Watch. While this is a hardware change, iOS would also likely change to accommodate it, possibly by updating the lock screen to display notifications in a different format, according to PhoneArena.\n\nRead more: iOS 14's best new iPhone features\n\nNow playing: Watch this: iPhone 13 rumors and what the next Apple phone needs\n\niOS 15 download instructions: The same as always\n\nIf you're part of Apple's developer program, you'll likely be able to download the iOS 15 developer beta after the new OS is announced in June to test your apps. The OS will likely be available to download as a public beta later in the summer (it was in early July for iOS 14), so you could download it then if you like, but be warned: Betas are usually buggy, and we don't recommend that you download it on your primary device.\n\nOnce iOS 15 is generally available, which we expect to be in September, Apple will likely send a notification letting you know you can update.

If you qualify, you could get between $500 and $3,600 per kid, depending on their age and your adjusted gross income this year. But you don't have to get your money in monthly payments.\n\nIf you opt out of the monthly checks, you'll get one large payment with your tax refund in 2022. Otherwise, you'll receive monthly payments from July until December, with the second half coming next year. If you'd rather opt out of getting the smaller child tax credit payments, we'll explain what you need to know, including why you might want to in the first place.\n\nWhile you're here, if you haven't received your $1,400 stimulus check yet or you're waiting on a \"plus-up\" payment, here's how to track it down. In addition, your state could owe you hundreds of dollars -- it takes 2 minutes to check. Plus, here's how Biden's new stimulus plan could bring you even more money.\n\nReasons you might want to opt out of the monthly child tax credit payments\n\nIf you'd rather receive your child tax credit payments in one lump sum rather than seven smaller payments, you can choose to opt out of the payments in July. Here are some reasons you may want to opt out:\n\nYou'd rather have one large payment next year.\n\nYou know your circumstances will change and don't want to deal with updating your information in the portal the IRS plans to open by July 1. (The portal is where you can update the IRS about any significant changes that pertain to you.)\n\nYou're concerned the IRS might accidentally send you an overpayment and you don't want to worry about paying that money back.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Child tax credit: How much are you getting?\n\nHow opting out of the monthly payments would work\n\nBe aware that if you opt out of receiving monthly child tax credits from July through December, you won't get your full payment -- or any payment at all -- until after the IRS processes your 2021 tax return next year. The full payment will then arrive with your tax refund, or could be used to offset any taxes you owe; you'll be in a similar situation to those people who had to claim missing stimulus checks on their taxes this year.\n\nSo if you have a child who's 5 years old or younger by the end of 2021 and your income meets the requirements, you'll get $3,600 total when you file your taxes in 2022. However, if you choose to receive six monthly payments this year, you'd get $300 each month and another $1,800 with your tax refund. You can use our child tax credit 2021 calculator to estimate how much you should get.\n\nIf you don't update your information in the portal and you file your taxes before the May 17 deadline, you'll automatically receive the monthly payments. More below on how to opt out.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Stimulus plus-up payments: What you need to know\n\nHow to opt out of the monthly child tax credit payments\n\nBy July 1, the IRS will open a portal that's designed specifically for the new child tax credit payments. You can also use it to opt out of receiving multiple payments this year. We've asked the IRS about how exactly you'll be able to do this. We do know the IRS will have paper forms available for those who don't have internet access. \"We will make forms and instructions for the forms available for folks who want to opt out,\" IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig said April 13.\n\nWe're not sure how the portal will look or what the process will be, but we do know it can be used to update your record with any changes that have happened since you last filed your taxes. For example, if you had a new baby in 2021 or have gained a new qualified dependent -- the IRS wouldn't have this information on file yet. Or maybe your income has changed recently.\n\nWe'll know more about the details you can change once the IRS portal is up and running -- the IRS won't have the resources to build the portal until after tax season.\n\nFor more child tax credit information, here's what you need to know if you share custody of a child.

Before you choose one, though, check out these Mother's Day flower delivery deals and sales -- including some exclusive discount codes we scored to save you moolah on a bouquet.\n\nAside from Enjoy Flowers and Amazon, we've personally tested all the services on this list and dropped in notes as to what we liked and didn't like about each one.\n\nBloomsy Box The deal: Use discount code FLOWERPOWER12 at checkout for 12% off your order. What we like about BloomsyBox: We liked this florist for its high-quality flowers that lasted a solid week. BloomsyBox has subscription options as well as a full inventory of bouquets, including tropical flowers, that you can order and send as one-time gifts. Most arrangements are around $50 and many have a modern appeal -- like this Pastel Bouquet. Note that it appears BloomsyBox does not have weekend delivery, so if you're sending a one-time bouquet or subscription gift, know that it will be delivered on the Friday before Mother's Day.\n\nRead more: Where to buy live plants online for Mother's Day in 2021\n\nUrbanstems The Deal: UrbanStems is including a free box of Neuhaus truffles with any purchase when you use exclusive promo code CNETMOM at checkout. These ain't no drug store chocolates either, we're talking real-deal Belgian truffles -- two dark chocolate and two pink Champagne. It's a $14 value and decadent add-on to your Mother's Day bouquet. What we like about UrbanStems: The sleek modern bouquets are what sets this flower delivery service apart from the rest. The classic bouquets are fine but nothing special or out of the ordinary -- although mine did last longer than some other bouquets. UrbanStems delivers anywhere in the country, and products run the gamut from classic lush bouquets such as The Bold with roses, ranunculus and stock to the more modern style we touched on earlier. The service also offers delivery on a selection of plants. The Cathy, for instance, is a low-maintenance xerographic air plant that might make a better pick for someone without a green thumb.\n\n1-800-Flowers The deal: 1-800-Flowers is one of the few services with a sale section, and it has some decent deals on bouquets if you're trying not to spend a fortune. We found bouquets from this popular flower delivery service starting at just $30 including roses and lilies and assorted tulip arrangements -- or this Sweet Garden bunch with roses, carnations and lavender button poms for $35. What we like about 1-800-Flowers: Flower arrangements from 1-800-Flowers may not have the same wow factor as other services on our list, but for moms with classic taste you can't go wrong ordering from this tried-and-true online florist. We appreciate the bargain bouquets, including some bunches as low as $30 or $40. 1-800-Flowers also offers same-day delivery and other gifting options such as plants, keepsakes and a number of eats and trinkets you can add to your purchase.\n\nRead more: Best Mother's Day foodie gifts in 2021\n\nBouqs The deal: Save 20% on your entire order with special code CNET20. What we liked about Bouqs: The service lands on our list not just for having a large selection, which it does, but also because so many of them looked really cool and creatively designed, including several tropical bouquets. It was by far the hardest service to choose just one arrangement from -- which I suppose could be a bad thing, too. I ordered the Wild About U bouquet and it arrived on time, fresh and fragrant. Beyond the classic picks, Bouqs also sells succulents, cacti, plants and potted flowers like this orchid ($59). The aforementioned and cleverly assembled Wild About U has both freshly cut flowers and succulents that can be potted or planted. You can also nab a pairing of flowers and chocolate so Mom has something to nosh on while she enjoys her fragrant bouquet.\n\nAmazon The deal: Amazon sells everything, so why wouldn't they sell flowers too? You can find bouquets with express shipping for as little as $29 from the mega online retailer. While we haven't had the chance to test Amazon's flowers yet, they source from different vendors (such as Farm Direct) so it's likely not quality controlled by Amazon anyhow. There are, of course, buyer reviews a-plenty to help you find something great for Mom. I'm loving this Flowering Fields with a vase included for just $35.\n\nEnjoy Flowers The deal: Use special code MOMLOVE15 for 15% off subscription orders or code MOM10 for 10% off any orders sitewide. This is the other service on this list we have yet to test, but if mom is a crafty type, she might enjoy creating \"do-it-yourself\" bouquets, like those offered by Enjoy Flowers. The DIY Collection is actually a flower delivery subscription service, so she'll have a new array of blooms delivered on a regular basis. You can choose from three sizes -- 20, 30 or 40 stems -- as well as between biweekly and monthly deliveries.\n\nOriginally published in February 2021.

With hardware co-engineered with Intel and software improvements developed in partnership with Microsoft, the premium PCs are built to be the center of a Galaxy ecosystem for \"mobile-first consumers.\"\n\n\"These are consumers used to being always connected on their phone. And so they want to also be always connected on their PC, and they want all of their devices to sync and work seamlessly together,\" said Danielle Moten, senior product manager for Samsung. The idea is to have fluidity between devices so you can start something on your phone and continue it on a laptop.\n\nThe Galaxy ecosystem isn't just about integration with Samsung's phones, though. These new PCs will be able to be connected with Galaxy tablets, Galaxy Buds, SmartThings smart home devices and SmartThings Find tags in a way that hasn't happened before. Essentially, Samsung is doing whatever it can to have all of its Galaxy products seamlessly work together, similar to the experience you get with Apple's devices. This is where the close work with Intel and Microsoft comes into play.\n\nSamsung\n\nThe Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360 have a custom Bluetooth enablement developed with Intel, for example, that allows Galaxy Buds to instantly connect without the process of going into settings and selecting them. \"It really helps pick up the interaction between the laptops and peripherals like the earbuds,\" said Gregory Bryant, EVP of the Client Computing Group at Intel. \"You have the basic Bluetooth protocol but we've actually built on top of that with Samsung to enable a better peripheral experience and a better device experience.\"\n\nOther features such as Quick Share allows for near-instant transferring of files and content between Galaxy devices, or you can use SmartThings Find on the Pro models to locate a Galaxy phone, tablet or wearables. You'll also be able to quickly expand your display onto your Galaxy tablet for easier multitasking. Deeper integration with Windows will let you do everything from taking calls and checking notifications to running up to five apps simultaneously directly on the laptops from your Galaxy phone.\n\nDan Ackerman/CNET\n\nAvailable in 13.3- and 15.6-inch sizes, the Galaxy Book Pro and Pro 360 are Intel Evo-verified PCs, which basically means they meet certain marks for performance, responsiveness and battery life. \"They're actually the world's thinnest Evo systems,\" Bryant said. \"It's the best of the mobile and PC ecosystems together.\"\n\nThese laptops are also the first Samsung Windows PCs with AMOLED full-HD displays and use an intelligent color engine to automatically tune your color space depending on what you're doing. AKG speakers with Dolby Atmos support complement the display, and its built-in microphones have intelligent noise canceling to help with ambient noise. However, despite all the premium features it has an industry-standard 720p webcam.\n\nBoth the Pro and Pro 360 run on 11th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 processors with integrated Iris Xe graphics, up to 16GB of memory and up to 512GB of storage (up to 1TB for the Galaxy Book Pro 360 15). Wi-Fi 6E support is also baked in for access to ultrawideband 6GHz networks.\n\nDrew Evans/CNET\n\nWi-Fi versions for the US market are available for preorders today and they will go on sale on May 14. Although the 13-inch Book Pro 360 will be available with optional 5G, that option won't immediately be available in the US, Samsung said. The 13-inch Galaxy Book Pro will start at $1,000 with the 15-inch version starting at $1,100. Going with the two-in-one Pro 360 adds $200 to the price: $1,200 for the 13-inch and $1,300 for the 15-inch. UK and Australia pricing wasn't available, but the price for the base 13-inch Pro converts to \u00a3725 and AU$1,295.\n\nThose who preorder between April 28 and May 13 can get $150 in future credit if ordered through Amazon; a $150 gift certificate through Best Buy; and either up to $150 eCertificate or free Galaxy Buds Pro through Samsung.com and Samsung Experience Stores.

It's handsome without being overly flashy and it's really nice to drive. We especially like the AMG versions, but the thing that's always seemed weird was if you wanted the most powerful GLC63 S version, you had to spring for the GLC Coupe. However, that won't be the case anymore.\n\nMercedes-Benz confirmed Tuesday that the 2022 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 S will now be available in the standard SUV guise. It promises to be hell on wheels thanks to its 503 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. Coupled with all-wheel drive, the GLC63 S can sprint to 60 mph in just 3.6 seconds. That's silly quick for the class. The GLC even managed a Nurburgring Nordschleife lap time of just 7 minutes, 49.369 seconds. For comparison, the BMW E46 M3 CSL -- a hardcore, track-oriented, lightweight special edition of a beloved sports car -- ran a 7-minutes, 50-second lap time.\n\nNow, the powertrain isn't really anything new; it's the same handbuilt 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine we know and love from other AMG models. The GLC63's chassis features standard AMG fare like adaptive dampers, big brakes, a locking rear differential and other go-fast hardware.\n\nThe AMG formula is kind of like Taco Bell, except instead of combining a bunch of the same cheap ingredients into something new that might give you mild gastrointestinal upset, it's a mixing a bunch of excellent German performance components and the result is a really fast SUV. We love the GLC63 S in its Coupe form and we have no reason to believe the more upright version will be any less enjoyable.\n\nLook for the 2022 Mercedes-AMG GLC63 S to arrive in the US near the end of 2021."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/Uddjtk8QbpeI12Llm_9AdsMsKtA=/1200x630/2019/07/18/c2c80116-f8b6-4690-8164-6c7558655f98/cnet-security-999-ring-door-view-cam.jpg", "Article's Title": "7 home security tips for apartments", "Article's Text": "Chris Monroe/CNET\n\nBurglaries are often crimes of opportunity, in which thieves try to find the quickest or easiest homes to target. Protecting apartments can be pretty different from securing houses, though. They usually have fewer potential entry points, but foot traffic right outside the front door can make it easier for would-be burglars to enter and leave without drawing attention to themselves.\n\nHere are some practical tips for keeping your apartment safe from burglars. Best of all, in many instances, these suggestions are low-cost and easy to do.\n\nChoose your apartment carefully\n\nIf you haven't moved into your apartment yet, the first step to a more secure unit is selecting the right one. Corner apartments on the ground floor are the most likely to be broken into, as they have two sides of exposure. If you're off the ground level and you have neighbors on either side, it means you mostly just need to worry about two points of access: your front door, and possibly a window if you have a fire escape.\n\nThink like a burglar\n\nOne of the simplest ways to stop crimes of opportunity is to remove the opportunity. Keep your valuables hidden, away from windows, where they might tempt thieves to target your place. While you might not be able to hide your TV, you can keep your blinds down when you're away from home during the day, when burglars are more likely to strike.\n\nYou can also use books and safes to store valuables like jewelry. That way, if the unfortunate happens and someone does get in, they will struggle to find items worth their time.\n\nInstall a security system\n\nOne of the best deterrents to thieves is a home security system. With one of these, you get door/window sensors, motion detectors and many other security gadgets that can alert you to intruders. If you have professional monitoring, your system will even contact the authorities on your behalf.\n\nDavid Priest/CNET\n\nDIY home security systems come with all the equipment you need while providing scalability, should you require more equipment in the future. You can find some of the best ones available here.\n\nAnd when choosing a home security system, make sure to find one that offers cellular and battery backup, in case of internet or power outage.\n\nBuy a cheap camera\n\nIf costs are a concern, even a single security device -- such as a $24 security camera -- give your apartment that extra little measure of security without the price tag attached to many full-fledged home security alternatives. For some would-be burglars, the mere presence of a security camera in the window could be enough to keep them from choosing your home.\n\nWireless video doorbells can also be helpful as a minor deterrent, and some companies even sell peephole cameras -- a particularly useful design for many apartments.\n\nWyze\n\nUse the buddy system\n\nIf you can, try to befriend someone living in the same apartment complex. Alternatively, if you have a friend or relative nearby, they will work as well. You can work together to check each other's apartments when the other is away to ensure the apartment is safe. And if they're your direct neighbor, they can even keep an ear out for unusual activity during the day or when you're out of town.\n\nSecure your windows\n\nWhen would-be burglars case an apartment, they are searching for an easy means of access. Often, the window might be the first place they test for a vulnerability. You can create another barrier of security by adding window locks.\n\nIf your landlord is opposed to you adding locks to your windows, there are plenty of non-permanent and affordable solutions that accomplish the same thing. Window locks also double as safety measures stopping pets or young children from opening windows they shouldn't when you're not paying attention.\n\nCheck your renter's insurance\n\nAlong with implementing these tips, make sure to have renter's insurance. Many apartments now require it before you can move in. However, if yours does not, buying a policy is simple to do and often surprisingly cheap. You can even package it with your current insurance provider if you have an auto policy.\n\nRenter's insurance can cover items stolen from your apartment. When selecting a policy, pay close attention to the personal property section. It includes which items the provider covers and the benefit amount. If you have valuables exceeding the benefit, be sure to increase coverage or ask your insurance carrier if there is another policy to supplement it.\n\nIn the meantime, check out these other tips and gadgets to keep your home secure:\n\nRead more:\n\nTurn an old phone into a security system camera in 3 steps.

In fact, it may be best to think of them less as credit cards and more as tools to help you repair or build your credit. In a nutshell, the best of these cards give you the opportunity to use a credit card a few times each month, pay your statement promptly and watch your credit score improve.\n\nUnlike traditional credit cards, which allow you to buy with credit and then pay it back, secured credit cards require an upfront security deposit. Your \"credit limit\" is equal to the amount you deposit, so you're basically borrowing against yourself. And if you don't pay off your balance each month, you may be subject to astronomically high interest rates. It's an arrangement that's really useful only to someone who needs to show the credit bureaus that they can reliably pay a bill each month.\n\nAs such, we prefer secured credit cards with two important features: no annual fee -- and the opportunity to recover your deposit and transition to a conventional card once your credit is in better shape. We've also included an option here for applicants with particularly low credit scores, who may be looking to avoid a hard credit check. Our list of the best secured credit cards is followed by some frequently asked questions about how they work:\n\nBest secured credit card APR: 26.99%\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nCredit line limits: $200 to $1,000\n\nDeposit refund: Considered for deposit refund starting at 6 months\n\nDeposit refund detail: \"We will monitor your account, and as you use it responsibly by doing things like making on-time payments, you may be able to earn back your deposit as a statement credit.\"\n\nOther fees: Late payment: $40\n\nCredit check: Soft check for preapproval, hard check with application The CapitalOne Secured Credit Card may give you up to $200 in credit when you deposit between $49 and $99 -- making it one of the few secured cards to offer actual credit. (Your particular terms depend on your specific application and credit score.) And this card checks all of the boxes: $0 annual fee, modest minimum deposit of $200 -- and the opportunity to get your deposit back after you promptly pay your statement for six months. Also nice: CapitalOne will preapprove you with a soft credit check, providing a risk-free peek at eligibility before you submit an official application.\n\nBest secured credit card with a higher credit line limit APR: 22.99%\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nCredit line limits: $300 to $4,900\n\nDeposit refund: Periodic review\n\nDeposit refund detail: \"We'll periodically review your account and, based on your overall credit history (including your account with us and other credit cards and loans), you may qualify to have your security deposit returned.\"\n\nOther fees: Late payment: $40; Returned payment: $29\n\nCredit check: Hard check with application The BankAmericard Secured Credit Card offers the table stakes: a $0 annual fee and an opportunity to get your deposit back and transition to a standard Visa credit card account. The only real potential drawback is the slightly higher minimum credit line: $300, which is $100 more than our other top picks. Still, this is a solid offering from a well-known national bank with solid online tools and plenty of retail locations.\n\nBest secured credit card with rewards APR: 22.99%\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nCredit line limits: $200 to $2,500\n\nDeposit refund: Monthly review starting at eight months\n\nDeposit refund detail: \"Automatic monthly reviews at eight months to see if your account qualifies to 'graduate' after showing responsible use of all your credit over time.\"\n\nOther fees: Late payment: $40; Returned payment: $40\n\nCredit check: Hard check with application Another excellent choice, the Discover it Secured credit card offers a $0 annual fee and $200 minimum credit line. You may qualify for a deposit refund after eight months of paying your statement in full and on time. It's worth noting that this card also features a rewards program -- though be cautioned that it could tempt you to spend more than you can afford. And if you're approved for the card with a lower credit line limit, the 1% cash back won't amount to much, anyway.\n\nBest secured credit card with no credit check required APR: 17.39%\n\nAnnual fee: $35\n\nCredit line limits: $200 to $3,000\n\nDeposit refund: None\n\nDeposit refund detail: N/A\n\nOther fees: Late payment: $38; Returned payment: $25\n\nCredit check: None The OpenSky Secured credit card application doesn't require a credit check, making it a good option -- and perhaps a last resort -- for people with low credit scores. If you've been declined by another issuer, this card may be a good second choice. But you'll have to pay the price: There's a $35 annual fee. And given that part of the credit rehab process is leaving credit accounts open for as long as possible -- in order to build back a credit history and work toward lower credit utilization, you may end up paying that annual fee for years to come. Still, if the card helps rebuild your credit, it's well worth the cost.\n\nSecured credit cards, compared Card issuer CapitalOne Secured Bank Americard Secured Discover it Secured OpenSky Secured Annual fee None None None $35 APR 26.99% 22.99% 22.99% 17.39% Credit line limits $200 to $1,000 $300 to $4,900 $200 to $2,500 $200 to $3,000 Deposit refund Considered for higher credit line and deposit refund starting at 6 months Periodic review of account for deposit refund Monthly review starting at 8 months to refund deposit None Other fees Late payment: $40 Late payment: $40; Returned payment: $29 Late payment: $40; Returned payment: $40 Late payment: $38; Returned payment: $25 Credit check type Soft for preapproval, hard with application Hard Hard None\n\nWhat is a secured credit card? This type of credit card usually requires an upfront deposit equal to the credit limit. So, for a card with a credit limit of $500, you'd need to deposit $500. Secured credit cards are still subject to late and rejected payment fees and generate interest on outstanding balances. As such, a secured credit card presents lower risk to card issuers and allows them to extend lines of credit to borrowers who otherwise wouldn't qualify.\n\nHow much should I deposit when I open an account? We recommend depositing no more than $300 to $400 for a secured credit card. Given that you want to keep your credit utilization low by paying off the account two or three times per month, the actual limit doesn't matter too much. Any additional funds should be placed in a checking or savings account to ensure you're keeping your card balance at $0.\n\nHow is my credit score calculated? Credit scores are calculated by looking at a variety of factors related to your credit history, including length of credit history, payment history, amounts owed, new credit and credit mix. The exact weight of each factor depends on the score model (FICO, VantageScore, or other) and your own credit history. If, for example, you have no credit history, the other factors may be weighted more heavily. (Check out this article for more information on credit scores.)\n\nHow long does it take to improve my credit score? After opening a secured credit card account, it will take around one to two months for the issuer to report it to credit bureaus, at which point it will begin impacting your credit score. Then it takes several additional months before the account's activity is substantial enough to make a difference. If you maintain a low or $0 balance and manage the rest of your financial house responsibly, you could raise your score several hundred points in a year or two, but it'll depend on your particular situation. If you have a longer credit history with a number of issues, it will take longer. If you have a shorter history, each month's activity will play a much larger role.\n\nWhy do you recommend paying off the account two to three times a month? By paying off your account more than once a month, you greatly reduce the risk of paying late, missing a payment or getting charged interest for an outstanding balance. We recommend choosing set days to make payments, like the 15th and 30th of every month, or the 10th, 20th, and 30th.\n\nHow often should I use my secured credit card? Swipe it two or three times a month to ensure the account is considered active. There's just no reason to use it any more than that. A secured credit card is a tool for repairing damaged credit or establishing new credit. To simplify your finances, it's best to make other purchases with cash or a debit card. Studies show that consumers who pay with credit tend to spend more than they would if they paid with cash, so if you're trying to right the ship or start on the right track, it's best to first establish a budget through cash or debit card purchases to ensure you don't spend beyond that budget.\n\nShould I keep a secured credit card once my credit is in better shape? Yes. Keeping the account open, active, and with a $0 balance will continue to improve your credit score as the length of the credit history grows and you maintain a low credit utilization.\n\nIs there ever a situation when I would use a secured credit card like a balance transfer credit card? No. We don't ever recommend transferring a balance to a secured credit card. Some websites may tout particular secured credit cards for introductory 0% APR offers but we strongly advise against transferring a balance. If you're looking for a card for balance transfers, check out our article on the best balance transfer credit cards or look into other ways of dealing with credit card debt.\n\nThe editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

If you've ever used beauty mode on your phone's selfie camera, you know what you're getting.\n\nTo turn it on, click the up arrow next to Start Video. Click Video Settings, and under My Video, check the box for Touch Up My Appearance.\n\nRead more: 'I am not a cat': Find and use the infamous lawyer cat filter everyone's talking about\n\n7. Set up a waiting room for added privacy\n\nYou've probably heard about Zoombombing -- when uninvited guests crash your Zoom meeting and disrupt it. One way to help prevent this from happening is by enabling the Waiting Room feature, so you can see who's attempting to join the meeting before allowing them access. To do so, go to Account Management > Account Settings. Click on Meeting, then click Waiting Room to enable the setting. (We've got more tips on how to prevent Zoombombing in your meetings here.)\n\n8. Create Zoom breakout rooms for smaller group discussion\n\nSplit your big Zoom meeting into up to 50 separate smaller sessions with breakout rooms. The meeting host can choose to split meeting participants into separate sessions automatically or manually, or can let participants select and enter any breakout session they like. The host can switch between sessions at any point.\n\nTo start a breakout room as the host, go to Account Management > Account Settings. Under the Meeting tab, go to Breakout Room, and make sure the setting is toggled on. You'll also see the option to allow meeting hosts to preassign participants to breakout rooms. (If the Breakout Room option is grayed out, that means it's been locked, and you need to contact your Zoom administrator.)\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\n9. Share your screen\n\nShare your screen for a Zoom meeting (or to watch a movie or play a game) with other participants by clicking the Share screen icon on the toolbar at the bottom of the meeting screen. You'll have the option to share your entire desktop, or just one of the windows you have open. Click the red Stop Share button at the top of the screen to go back to being a normal participant in the meeting.\n\n10. React with emoji onscreen\n\n\n\nZoom\n\nIf you're muted in a meeting, you can still let the hosts know your thoughts with emoji reactions. Send a thumbs up or a clapping emoji to communicate without interrupting the meeting (by default, those reactions have a yellow skin tone, but you can customize that on the Zoom desktop app). In April, Zoom added about 40 emoji reactions, instead of the six previously available.\n\nTo react during a meeting, click the Reactions tab at the bottom of the meeting screen (it's in the same panel as mute audio and video, to the right) and choose the one you want. Emoji will disappear after 5 seconds.\n\nIf the meeting organizer enables the nonverbal feedback feature, participants can place an icon such as a raised hand next to their name to communicate. Every participant will be able to see each other's feedback.\n\n11. Learn handy keyboard shortcuts\n\nFor those who don't like clicking around their screen, Zoom has a ton of helpful keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate the app on your desktop without using your mouse. Find commands to join a meeting, start or stop recording, enter full screen and share your screen (more on that below). Check out Zoom's full list of hot keys and keyboard shortcuts.\n\n12. Turn on gallery view\n\nGallery view lets you see everyone in the meeting at once, instead of just the person speaking. To turn that on, click the tab that says Gallery View in the top right corner. If the meeting has 49 or fewer attendees, you'll see all of their screens displayed on one page. If there are more, you'll have the option to move between multiple pages. Change it back by clicking Speaker View in that same top right corner.\n\n13. Put yourself in the same virtual background as your coworkers with immersive view\n\nZoom\n\nZoom's immersive view feature lets you put yourself in the same virtual background as your fellow video chat participants -- be it a conference room, classroom or anywhere else you can think of. If you're the meeting or webinar host, start the Zoom meeting on your desktop (it will be enabled by default for all free and single pro accounts using Zoom 5.6.3 or higher). In the top right corner, where you find Speaker or Gallery View, you'll see the option to enable Immersive View. Click Immersive View, and choose from one of Zoom's provided scenes, or upload your own.\n\n\n\nYour meeting participants or webinar hosts will now be placed in the same virtual background and will appear that way on every participant's screen.\n\n14. Hide nonvideo participants\n\nOn a larger call, your screen can get cluttered with participants, which can be distracting, especially if some don't have their cameras on. Hide the participants who aren't using video by going to Settings > Video > Meetings, and check Hide nonvideo participants. Now you'll only be distracted by your co-workers' pets and children who appear on video.\n\n15. Use the vanishing pen to highlight without having to go back and erase\n\nZoom\n\nZoom's vanishing pen feature lets you draw on your shared screen to call attention to text or objects, but then fades away so you don't have to go back and erase your markings. To use it, share your screen, and click Annotate. On the menu that pops up, click Vanishing Pen.\n\n16. Record the meeting to your computer\n\n\n\nBoth free and paid Zoom subscribers can record their meeting to their laptop or computer using the desktop app (you can't record on mobile at the moment, unless you have a paid account -- keep reading for more on that). Those recorded files can then be uploaded to a file storage service such as Google Drive or Dropbox, or a video streaming service such as YouTube or Vimeo.\n\nTo enable local recording, go to Settings > Recording, and toggle it on. When you're hosting a Zoom meeting, click the Record icon on the bottom toolbar.\n\n17. Record a meeting to the cloud\n\nIf you have one of Zoom's paid plans (which start at $15 a month), you can take a recording that will save directly to the cloud (or to your computer if you prefer). Tap the record button on the bottom toolbar, and you'll have the option to make it either local or in the cloud. You can do this on either desktop or mobile.\n\n18. Host a group meeting longer than 40 minutes\n\nOn Zoom's free basic tier, group meetings can only last up to 40 minutes (though one-on-one meetings are unlimited in time). To get unlimited group time, upgrade to a paid account.\n\n19. Host more than 100 people\n\nIf you have a group of more than 100 people to host for work or school, you have to upgrade to a paid professional account. If you upgrade to the highest tier (Enterprise Plus), you can host up to 1,000 participants.\n\nWatch our video on how to make your webcam video look and sound great online and make sure to subscribe to the How To Do It All channel on YouTube for more how to videos."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/iqQUOgYhBwq_M83dljSG3_uaXJA=/1200x630/2021/04/28/b89cfc02-5a63-4e55-8f73-e005756e2479/screen-shot-2021-04-28-at-10-16-00-am-2.png", "Article's Title": "Samsung Unpacks its Galaxy Book Pro, Pro 360 and more", "Article's Text": "Screenshot by Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nIt's only April and we're already up to Samsung's third Galaxy Unpacked event of 2021. This one wasn't about phones, though -- it launched the company's lesser-known, at least in the US, Galaxy Book laptops. Today's new models start at $999 for the Galaxy Book Pro and $1,199 for the Pro 360, and new budget Galaxy Book and mainstream $1,399 Galaxy Book Odyssey gaming laptops. Galaxy Book is its line of laptops designed for more connected operation, thin, light and intended to work with the rest of the company's products including its SmartThings. This year the company highlighted seamless operation between Windows and Android, and overall it now sounds eerily like Apple's ecosystem, but with the extra perk of touchscreens that make it even more phone-like.\n\nThe Galaxy Book and Galaxy Book Pro models were designed in conjunction with Microsoft and Intel and bear Intel's Evo branding for its current-gen, light and responsive laptops incorporating Thunderbolt 4, up to an 11th-gen Core i7, Wi-Fi 6E and processing optimized for conferencing. Intel says it's the thinnest Evo design yet. Samsung claims they weigh only 2.2 pounds including the charger.\n\nThe Galaxy Book Pro is a clamshell, while the Pro 360 is (as you'd expect) a 2-in-1. Both come in 13- and 15-inch and gold, blue or bronze. Both incorporate OLED displays with Samsung's built in low-blue-light technology. The Pro 360 supports the S-Pen, which is bundled. They have Mac OS-like Live Wallpaper that changes with the time of day. The keyboard has lower travel at 1mm, but refined scissor switches for better bounce.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Samsung's new Galaxy Book laptops add AMOLED screens,...\n\nSamsung claims you'll be able to get 16 hours of work time out of the energy-denser battery and up to 8 hours on a 30 minute charge. The latter is an Evo requirement.\n\nWhile they're optimized for portability and have updated noise-cancelling mics, they still have only 720p webcams. And while the Pro 360 incorporates 5G, it won't be coming to the US until later.\n\nThe 15-inch Galaxy Book also bumps to 11th-gen Intel Core CPUs and adds LTE connectivity. A new Galaxy Book Odyssey goes RTX 3050 Ti and 11th-gen Tiger Lake. They won't be available in the US initially, either, though the Odyssey is expected to start shipping here in August.\n\nThe last Galaxy Books were announced in Oct. 2019, but most didn't ship until May of 2020. The new models are shipping much sooner.\n\nThere's a lot of syncing among the Galaxy devices via proprietary apps that (to me) look like Start Menu bloat -- there's an individual app for everything, just like a phone, though they are the same apps as on the phones. Photos natively integrates with One Drive. Use your Samsung tablet as a second screen and drag and drop files between devices."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/hysmeeabv1KfY87UP1RN_9DCntg=/1200x630/2020/08/06/97be2efb-7d09-4536-b55d-2d11a97dd861/breaking-the-piggy-bank-stimulus-check-cash-money-savings-debt-personal-finance-018.jpg", "Article's Title": "Best savings account for May 2021", "Article's Text": "There are plenty of ways to use money to make money. You could invest in equities or a mutual fund, but those come with risk. A certificate of deposit, or CD, may provide a decent interest rate and the risk is minuscule, given that it's federally insured, but it usually locks up your money for a set period of time. That may be good for reaching a savings goal, but problematic if you want your savings to double as an emergency fund when needed. If you're looking to make a modest return on your money but keep it handy for major purchases -- like a house or a car -- then you must look to the humble savings account. A savings account is absolutely essential when it comes to your personal finances, and you need to be sure that any savings account you open meets your needs and helps you accomplish your long-term financial goals.\n\nThere are lots of factors to consider when opening a savings account, but perhaps the most pressing is interest. Even a high interest savings account will only deliver an extremely modest return. And we want to be entirely clear about this: High-yield savings account interest rates, which are influenced, but not directly set, by the Federal Reserve, currently top out at around 1%. So, if your savings account had an account balance of $100,000 for a year, you'd earn approximately $1,000 in interest on it. That's not much, even with compound interest.\n\nAnd yet, with all the protections of federal deposit insurance (securing balances up to $250,000) and relatively unfettered access to your money, a savings account serves a purpose. Plus, they're easy to apply for and the eligibility requirements are minimal; even a child can open an account with a parent or guardian co-signer and the minimum initial deposit.\n\nMost savings accounts generally fall into two categories. There's the online-only kind, which is typically offered by newer banks that don't have a retail presence. With no branches to maintain or tellers to pay, online banking tends to offer a higher annual percentage yield, or APY, which pays you more in interest over time; these high APY accounts are often referred to as \"high yield.\" In contrast, most bigger institutions, regional banks and local credit unions that do have physical branches, provide a way to make deposits or withdraw funds in person and have a face-to-face conversation. Again, there's none of that with an online bank: All your transactions are done online or using some other bank's ATM and your customer service options are typically limited to an online chat, email or phone call. For people looking for a high APY who are already familiar with mobile banking and are comfortable with direct deposit, this is fine. If you want to interact with a person, however, online banking might not be for you.\n\nThere's also a third scenario: Some banks have branches only in certain states and may offer a high-yield online-only deposit account exclusively to people who don't live in one of those states. According to Ken Tumin, founder and editor of DepositAccounts.com, these older financial institutions see these specialized high yield account options as a way to receive more deposits without having to build a physical branch.\n\nBest savings accounts, compared\n\nBest online savings account Highest interest rate Best for in-person banking Another good choice Another good choice Bank/institution High Yield Chime Savings Account Sallie Mae SmartyPig Citi Accelerate PNC High Yield Savings Account Vio Bank Online High Yield Savings Account APY 0.5% Up to 0.7% 0.5% 0.4% 0.57% Minimum deposit $0 $0 $0 $0 $100 Estimated annual earnings on $1,000 deposit $5 Up to $8 $5 $5.00 $5.70 Branch access No No Yes No No Monthly fee $0 $0 $4.50 when your balance falls under $500 $0 $5 when you choose to receive paper statements\n\nIn choosing the best savings accounts, we evaluated more than a dozen offered by a wide variety of national and regional banks. Though we steered clear of local banks and financial institutions that don't serve a broad swath of customers in the US, it may be worthwhile to take a close look at your local bank and credit union options as you build your savings plan. You want to find an account that offers a consistently high interest rate regardless of your daily balance -- at the moment, savings account APYs may fluctuate on a weekly basis -- as well as low or no fees, low or no minimum balance, have FDIC insurance and convenient options for making withdrawals and deposits (direct deposit is key) online or in person. We also looked into factors like mobile banking, minimum deposit requirement, how easy it is to check your account balance, if there's an ATM fee, whether the financial institution requires a monthly maintenance fee, whether there's a minimum balance requirement and so much more.\n\nWhether you want to open your first savings account or find a different place for your money, you've come to the right place. As mentioned above, we've looked at multiple savings accounts and our picks for the best savings account, which we frequently update, can help you find the right bank for your situation.\n\nChime Interest rate: 0.5% APY\n\n0.5% APY Availability: All 50 states\n\nAll 50 states Minimum deposit: $0\n\n$0 Monthly fees: $0 If you're comfortable working with a financial institution that's exclusively online, Chime's high-yield account offers the best combination of features for a personal savings account: no fees, convenient ways to move money in and out, a slick app -- and one of the higher interest rates available with .5% APY savings account rate. You also get a free Chime checking account -- the two are a package deal, like conjoined twins -- which serves as the primary mechanism for depositing and withdrawing funds. You can deposit checks remotely via Chime's modern, capable app, and the included Visa debit card can be used at more than 38,000 MoneyPass and Visa Plus Alliance ATMs. (You can also deposit cash at any store in the Green Dot network, which includes Walgreens, CVS and Family Dollar, though the onerous $4.95 per deposit fee should make that an option of last resort.) There's no minimum balance required, and Chime lets you round up purchases to the nearest dollar and deposit the difference in your savings account (similar to Acorns, the micro-investing service).\n\nSallie Mae Interest rate: Up to 0.7% APY\n\nUp to 0.7% APY Availability: All 50 states\n\nAll 50 states Minimum deposit: $0\n\n\n\n$0 Monthly fees: $0 Sallie Mae, perhaps best known as a student loan provider, also offers a goal-based savings account with no minimum deposit and the highest APY currently available. The company frames its SmartyPig account as \"a free online piggy bank for people saving for financial goals like holiday gifts, vacations, and even retirement.\" That noted, using this bank account to save for retirement isn't recommended -- especially because of Sallie Mae's odd, regressive approach to interest rates, which start at a 0.7% higher APY on balances below $2,500 and gradually decrease to 0.55% on balances above $50,000. As such, this account is best-suited to people who are new to saving, who plan to build or maintain balances under $10,000 and who might ultimately benefit from less convenient access to their money. That's because the SmartyPig account comes with no ATM card, Sallie Mae doesn't have branches where you can make deposits or withdrawals, and there's no app to enable easy transfers. (Though you can transfer or withdraw funds at any time through the bank's web-based interface, customers are encouraged to set up a recurring automatic deposit from a paycheck or other account.) Still, if you're looking to save a modest amount of money for a specific purpose -- and maximize your interest rate while you're doing it -- SmartyPig is worth a look.\n\nCiti Interest rate: 0.5% APY\n\n0.5% APY Availability: Throughout the US except California; Connecticut; Illinois; Maryland; Nevada; New Jersey; New York; Virginia; parts of Florida; Washington, DC; and Puerto Rico\n\nThroughout the US except California; Connecticut; Illinois; Maryland; Nevada; New Jersey; New York; Virginia; parts of Florida; Washington, DC; and Puerto Rico Minimum deposit: $0\n\n$0 Monthly fees: $4.50 when your balance falls under $500 If you prefer dealing with a large bank, Citi's Accelerate account offers a competitive APY and all the benefits of a national chain with branches across 42 US states. You get free access to more than 60,000 Citi and other surcharge-free ATMs, 24/7 customer service and other perks if you link a Citi checking account to your savings account. Though this bank account requires no minimum initial deposit, Citi will charge you $4.50 per month if your checking account balance falls below $500. Note that although Citibank is one of the largest banks in the world, it doesn't have a foothold in every state. If branch access is your priority, you're better off with a different personal savings account if you live in California; Connecticut; Illinois; Maryland; Nevada; New Jersey; New York; Virginia; Washington, DC; Puerto Rico; or one of several parts of Florida.\n\nPNC Interest rate: 0.4% APY\n\n0.4% APY Availability: Accessible in the 19 states that don't have a PNC branch\n\nAccessible in the 19 states that don't have a PNC branch Minimum deposit: $0\n\n$0 Monthly fees: $0 Available only to residents of the 19 states where PNC doesn't have a retail location, which are New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin and Washington DC. PNC's online-only high-yield savings account offers a decent interest rate, no minimum initial deposit, no minimum balance, no monthly maintenance fee or other fees.\n\nVio Bank Interest rate: 0.57% APY\n\n0.57% APY Availability: All 50 states\n\nAll 50 states Minimum deposit: $100\n\n$100 Monthly fees: $5 when you choose to receive paper statements A subsidiary of MidFirst Bank, the largest privately owned bank in the US, Vio Bank itself is a purely an online bank. So, you'll need to manage all your bank account transactions online -- either on the bank's website or in its app. Though Vio's APY isn't as high as that offered by other banks, its annual percentage yield is consistently competitive. That noted, you'll need to make an initial deposit of at least $100 to open an account, and this online bank will charge you a $5 fee per month if you choose to have paper statements delivered. Otherwise, the fee schedule is more or less similar to what you'll find at other banks.\n\nWhat are the major differences between checking and savings accounts?\n\nMost checking accounts are designed to facilitate transactions and payments, whether via a debit card, mobile app such as Apple Pay or a paper check. Most checking accounts don't offer interest; those that do usually provide a very low rate of 0.1% or less.\n\nSavings accounts offer significantly higher interest rates and online-only banks typically offer the highest yields. These accounts provide a safe place to store money while keeping it accessible. Until recently, savings account holders were generally limited to making six transactions per month.\n\nHow many withdrawals can I make from a savings account?\n\nIn normal times, the Federal Reserve limits account holders to six withdrawals a month (to preserve liquidity for financial institutions). In response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve made a rule change to Regulation D allowing unlimited withdrawals without any monthly fee penalty.\n\nWhat is a high-yield savings account?\n\nA high-yield savings account offers a higher interest rate than a traditional savings account. These accounts may have certain deposit requirements, monthly fees or be available only to customers in certain states.\n\nTraditional savings accounts at a bank will have interest rates ranging from 0.05% to 0.1% while high-yield savings can go as high as 1%.\n\nWho sets interest rates? How often do they change? And why are rates so low right now?\n\nThe Federal Reserve sets a target rate range, which influences the specific interest rates set by individual banks. These rates may change over time; and adjustments often follow a meeting of the Board of Governors, which takes place every five to eight weeks. Since the Great Recession period, from 2007 to 2009, the Fed has consistently kept rates low, which has led to low interest rates for savings accounts. At the moment, the average interest rate for savings accounts is 0.05%.\n\nThat noted, many banks will offer a higher savings rate to attract new customers. The market for high-yield savings accounts is competitive, with some banks offering particularly high rates for an introductory period of time. Because of this, interest rates offered by a financial institution can change quite regularly.\n\nDo you have to pay taxes on the interest earned from a savings account?\n\nYes. Your bank will send you a 1099-INT form each year when your savings account earns more than $10 in interest.\n\nSavings accounts researched\n\nAlly Online Savings Account\n\nPNC High Yield Savings\n\nVio Bank High Yield Online Savings Account\n\nMarcus High Yield Savings\n\nDiscover Online Savings Account\n\nAmerican Express High Yield Savings Account\n\nCiti Accelerate\n\nNationwide My Savings\n\nCitizens Online Savings Account\n\nSallie Mae SmartyPig\n\nAffirm Savings\n\nChime Savings Account\n\nSynchrony High Yield Savings\n\nPopular Direct Select Savings\n\nMore financial advice\n\nThe editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

Streaming used to mean sacrificing sound quality, but that's no longer the case -- it may surprise you that streaming music can sound indistinguishable from, or even better than, an old-fashioned CD.\n\nThe question is, which streaming music service is best for you? We checked out Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, Deezer, Qobuz and Pandora Premium to see how each platform stacks up for your subscription buck. While most offer music catalogs of more than 50 million songs, each has its own unique pros and cons. We've also left out services that only play music in a radio format and don't offer a la carte listening that lets you choose your own songs.\n\nServices typically charge $10 a month and don't have a contract, but swapping between them isn't as straightforward as TV streaming. If you don't want to rebuild your library and playlists from scratch if you switch, you have two main options -- a music locker service such as YouTube Music, or the library import tool Soundiiz. The latter option can read the library from each of your music services and transfer them, and while there is a $4.50 monthly charge you can always cancel once you've converted your library.\n\nSarah Tew/CNET\n\nSo which music streaming services offer the best combination of price, library size and sound quality? Read on to find an in-depth look at each of the services and a feature comparison, along with a full price breakdown in the chart at the bottom of the page. And if you want the TL;DR, these are the top three.\n\nAngela Lang/CNET Spotify is the pioneer in music streaming and arguably the best-known service. It offers a number of curated music discovery services, including its Discover Weekly playlist, and is constantly implementing new ones, such as Stations. It's also ramping up its non-music content with a push towards podcasts. It's a close race between Spotify Premium and Apple Music, but Spotify wins as the best music streaming service overall thanks to a fun, easy-to-use interface, an extensive catalog and the best device compatibility. Spotify also offers our favorite free tier: Without paying a dime or providing a credit card number, you can still stream Spotify Connect to numerous Wi-Fi devices. While Spotify recently announced a new HiFi tier it appears to be capped at CD quality unlike similar options from Tidal or Qobuz. It also hiked prices on Family plans in the US and other plans in the US and Europe, but the base price remains $10 per month in the US.

There are two ways to upload your music: free with a Music subscription, but with DRM; or $25, \u00a322 or AU$35 a year for iTunes match which will let you download again even without a Music subscription. Not surprisingly, Apple Music is an excellent choice if you've invested heavily in Apple devices. If you own an Apple HomePod or Mini, it is the default subscription service to summon music with your voice. Apple Music also makes the ideal companion for an iPod Touch, which, amazingly, is still a thing. There's also ton of curated playlists, many handcrafted by musicians and tastemakers, but it lacks the robust sharing options built into Spotify.

Its higher-priced options are especially suited to people seeking the best audio quality. While Qobuz promises arguably better sound quality (no MQA decoder required) both its subscriber base and catalog are dwarfed by Tidal's. Now partly owned by Jack Dorsey's Square, Tidal offers lossless audio streaming with sound quality that is virtually identical to -- or better than -- CD. Tidal says its catalog exceeds 70 million tracks, and now includes longtime holdouts Metallica as well.

The good news is that YouTube Music is a mostly impressive service, and Google has retained the predecessor's music locker system. If you have a legacy Google Play Music account you may be able to still transfer your library over to YouTube Music. And it's not just legacy content: YouTube Music allows users to upload new tracks to its online music locker, too.\n\nIn even better news, YouTube Music offers a cleaner interface than Google Play Music. Instead of playlists, YouTube Music offers well-curated radio stations, which are the standout features. Unlike playlists, which are finite and contain specific tracks, radio stations play endlessly and are updated often.\n\nThe Good\n\nMonthly fee includes subscription to YouTube Music: commercial-free streaming on YouTube and YouTube Music\n\nOver 40 million tracks\n\nRetains Google Play Music's music locker system: You can transfer existing songs from the old service, plus upload new ones in YouTube Music\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe continued existence of Google Play Music is confusing for existing users\n\nBest for: Heavy YouTube users and Android device users.\n\nPandora Premium\n\nOne of the most popular streaming radio services in the US, Pandora also offers the a la carte Premium ($10 a month) and no-ads Plus ($5 a month). The result is more flexibility than most competitors, and Premium has gained plenty more subscribers in recent years, even if the service is behind in terms of overall catalog size.\n\nThe Good\n\nOne of the largest user bases, thanks to its free version\n\n\n\nPandora's Music Genome Project analyzes each track according to 450 different attributes in order to give better suggestions\n\n\n\nThe Bad\n\nIts audio quality is among the lowest available, even on the Premium subscription (192Kbps)\n\n\n\nIt doesn't really offer enough of an incentive for an upgrade from the free tier compared to the others here\n\n\n\nNot available outside the US\n\n\n\nBest for: Pandora Premium is of most interest to people who already use Pandora and want to be able to pick exactly what they listen to. We'd recommend it to almost no one else.\n\nQobuz\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Ty Pendlebury/CNET\n\nQobuz launched in the US in February 2019 with a clean interface, hi-res audio streams (which unlike Tidal's don't need an MQA decoder) and the ability to buy lossless music. It offers two plans -- the hi-res Studio Premier for $15 a month and the $249 annual Sublime Plus, which offers discounts on the store. At 50 million tracks, Qobuz's streaming catalog isn't quite at the level of Tidal or Spotify, but it should be sufficient for everything but the more obscure artists.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe app is really clean and fun to use\n\n\n\nAbility to listen to 24-bit music without needing a specialized decoder\n\n\n\nOne of the most affordable hi-res services\n\nFirst 24-bit streaming service on Sonos\n\nThe Bad\n\nSome gaps in the catalog\n\n\n\nBest for: Audiophiles who want hi-res music for a decent price plus the ability to buy and download albums\n\nDeezer\n\nFrench stalwart Deezer has been operating in the States since 2016, and it has a lot to offer, including a free tier (mobile only) and 56 million tracks. It has more than subscribers than some others on this list thanks, in part, to its previous affiliation with Cricket Wireless. The main Premium plan is $10 a month but users are also able to upgrade to a lossless version (CD quality) for $15 a month. While it reportedly boasts more users than Tidal, the service doesn't offer enough to differentiate it from its similarly priced competitors.\n\nBest services compared\n\nAmazon Music Unlimited Apple Music Spotify Tidal YouTube Music Monthly fee Prime members: $8, \u00a38, N/A; Non-Prime members: $10, \u00a310, AU$12; Alexa-only service: Free $10, \u00a310, AU$12 $10, \u00a310, AU$12 Premium: $10, \u00a310, AU$15; HiFi: $20, \u00a320, AU$24 $9.99, \u00a39.99, AU$11.99 Free option?

Until recently this list excluded Pandora, but now that the company also offers a Premium tier we've included it here. Slacker Radio, TuneIn and iHeartRadio are other radio-style services that play music stations based around a theme or artist, without you explicitly picking tracks.\n\nMusic lockers: Your MP3s in the cloud\n\nAmazon was one of the first services to offer uploading your MP3 collection into the cloud, but this was officially discontinued in 2018. Meanwhile, the Apple and Google services listed either allow you to combine your personal music collection with the streaming catalog, though tagging and organization can be a time-consuming challenge (your myriad live Phish tracks won't organize themselves). Still, if you've invested money in digital music over the years, those two services offer a patch to continue enjoying that music online.\n\nMusic catalog sizes compared\n\nThe number of songs offered by a music service used to be one of the main differentiators, but most now have between 50 million and 70 million songs or more. However, depending on your favored genre, some of them have a more robust catalog that include many under-the-radar, indie or hip-hop artists. If you're musically inclined, constantly on the hunt for your favorite new band, a streaming service like Spotify or Tidal may be more up your alley. Users who are less ambitious about expanding their musical taste will be satisfied with the smaller catalogs Amazon Music Unlimited or Pandora offer. Apple Music is somewhere in the middle, offering a healthy mix of mainstream tunes and underground unknowns."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/kruBPXuQBbC6x5UM7Lo9zgBT-E0=/1200x630/2021/04/27/078480b5-b205-41f0-9cfe-7b033ba12458/apples-colorful-new-2021-imac-heres-what-we-know-mp4-00-00-00-05-still001.png", "Article's Title": "CDC loosens mask restrictions, Spotify launches podcast subscriptions - Video", "Article's Text": "Mars helicopter has more to do, Apple will show off new gadgets..."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/f5p-bplvfUVvDNI1tXIR4A-lpCA=/1200x630/2019/08/14/8578e587-9a31-40a6-9740-1754ecd8ad66/apple-card-credit9637.jpg", "Article's Title": "Best credit cards for May 2021", "Article's Text": "The best credit cards make for a convenient way to pay for stuff, earn cash or travel rewards and build up your credit score. But with all of those benefits, perils abound. A credit card user who spends beyond their means, pays bills late or gets caught up in onerous interest rates and fees can quickly end up in a quicksand-filled ditch of debt.\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of credit card options out there that will both fit your existing spending habits and let you maximize your credit without falling into debt. To find the right credit card for you, we've assembled our picks of the best credit cards by category -- from best rewards credit card to best travel credit card -- considering credit limits, interest rates and rewards. Note that we continuously monitor these cards and keep our eyes peeled for new ones, too. Our current top picks for the best credit cards are presented below.\n\nBest cash-back card Chase Reward rates: Unlimited 1.5% cash back on all purchases and 5% cash back on travel, 3% cash back on dining, 3% cash back on drugstore purchases\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nNew member bonus: $200\n\nBonus redemption threshold: $500 in first three months\n\nCredit requirement: 670 to 850\n\nIntro APR: 0% on purchases (15 months)\n\nAPR for purchases: 14.99% to 23.74% variable\n\nAPR for balance transfers: 14.99% to 23.74% variable\n\nBalance transfer fee: 5% (minimum of $5)\n\nMost of the best cash-back cards offer a simple, flat rate and no fees. Until recently, the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card gave you all of that -- a flat rate of 1.5% cash back on all purchases, without a spending limit, no annual fee and flexible redemption policies. In September 2020, however, the credit card company improved on that deal, adding a little bit of worthwhile complexity and ratcheting up the reward rates on travel (5%) purchased through Chase Ultimate Rewards points, dining (3%), and drugstore purchases (3%). While it's no longer the simplest, we think it's the best cash-back card for most people. Check out the full review in CNET's roundup of the best cash-back credit cards.\n\nBest credit card for travel rewards CapitalOne Reward rates: 2x miles on everyday purchases\n\nAnnual fee: $95\n\nWelcome bonus: 100,000 miles\n\nBonus redemption threshold: Spend $20,000 in the first 12 months (or still earn 50,000 miles if you spend $3,000 in the first 3 months)\n\nAPR: 17.24% to 24.49% variable\n\nForeign transaction fees: None\n\nCredit requirement: 720 to 850\n\nThe Capital One Venture is a straightforward, easy-to-use credit card for booking travel with rewards miles. And those rewards miles are generated whenever you spend -- so there's no need to worry whether a particular category is eligible. Check out the full review in CNET's roundup of the best travel credit cards.\n\nThe best credit card for students Standard APR: 12.99% to 21.99% variable (0% intro APR on purchases for the first 6 months)\n\nPenalty APR: None\n\nLate payment fee: Up to $40\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nCash back rewards: 2% on gas stations and restaurants, up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter; 1% on all other purchases\n\nForeign transaction fee: 0%\n\nStandout feature: No late fee for first late payment (up to $40 thereafter)\n\nEligibility requirements: No credit history required, proof of income\n\nThe Discover it Student Chrome offers a winning combination of cash back and other rewards as well as lenient terms for first-time credit card holders. You won't get dinged for a late payment -- at least the first one -- or have to deal with an exorbitant penalty APR. And getting 1 to 2% back in rewards each month is a welcome bonus. Note that Discover offers another similar card, the Discover it Student Cash Back credit card, but the rotating bonus categories make things overcomplicated, especially for first-time cardholders. Check out the full review in CNET's roundup of the best student credit cards.\n\nBest credit card for balance transfers Introductory APR: 20 months of 0% APR for balance transfers and purchases\n\nStandard APR: 13.99% to 23.99%, variable\n\nPenalty APR: None\n\nIntroductory balance transfer fee: N/A\n\nStandard balance transfer fee: 3% or $5, whichever is greater\n\nHow long you have to make transfers: 60 days\n\nCredit requirement: 680 to 850\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nPaying down credit card debt can be exhausting. A balance on an account with a high interest rate can take years to pay off -- or worse, balloon out of control. A balance transfer credit card, used properly, can offer you a relatively cost-efficient opportunity to catch up. The US Bank Visa Platinum offers one of the longest zero percent introductory APR periods -- 20 months -- combined with one of the lowest fees, 3%. Learn more in CNET's roundup of the best balance transfer credit cards.\n\nBest credit card for Amazon and Whole Foods shoppers Reward rates: 5% on Amazon, Whole Foods; 2% at restaurants, gas stations, drugstores; 1% on everything else\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nNew member bonus: $100 Amazon Gift Card\n\nBonus redemption threshold: Card approval\n\nCredit requirement: 580 to 850\n\nIntro APR: None\n\nAPR for purchases: 14.24% to 22.24% variable\n\nAPR for balance transfers: 14.24% to 22.24% variable\n\nBalance transfer fee: 5% (minimum of $5)\n\nThis rewards card is a must-have for anyone who shops regularly on Amazon. And given that you can buy just about anything on Amazon -- 5% back on all eligible purchases there is pretty sweet. The rewards card also features 2% cash back at restaurants, gas stations and drug stores and 1% on everything else. (Note that Amazon offers a basic, non-Prime member card that features 3% cash back on Amazon purchases; but if you're spending more than $250 per month at Amazon or Whole Foods, you should be a Prime member.) Check out the full review in CNET's roundup of the best cash-back credit cards.\n\nBest credit card for Apple Pay super users (and privacy enthusiasts) Apple Reward rates: 3% on Apple, Uber and Walgreens purchases; 2% on Apple Pay purchases; 1% on everything else\n\nAnnual fee: $0\n\nNew member bonus: $0\n\nBonus redemption threshold: None\n\nCredit requirement: 580 to 850\n\nIntro APR: None\n\nAPR for purchases: 12.49% to 23.49% variable\n\nAPR for balance transfers: Not offered\n\nBalance transfer fee: Not offered\n\nThe Apple Card is a beautiful but odd duck. Crafted out of sleek titanium, the credit card looks like it was birthed from a slot on a MacBook Pro. But it's the iPhone that unleashes its true potential: When you use Apple Pay -- the company's digital wallet and touchless payment feature -- you get 2% cash back on all purchases. (The Citi Double Cash Card offers up to 2% on everything, no matter how you pay.) Otherwise, the Apple Card's rewards program is a mish-mash of cash rewards: 3% cash back on eligible purchases of Apple gear and services, Uber and Walgreens purchases and 1% cash rewards on everything else. But there are a few other noteworthy features. The Apple Card's privacy policy states that it will \"never share or sell your data to third parties for marketing or advertising\" -- a commitment that's rare in an ordinarily mercenary industry. Apple delivers your cash-back rewards at the end of each day, instead of the usual month-long billing cycle. And Apple does not charge late fees, an annual fee or foreign transaction fees. Check out the full review in CNET's roundup of the best cash-back credit cards.\n\nBelow, we've broken down the details of each of our picks for the best credit card so that you can determine which is the right fit for you. We've followed it up with answers to some questions you may have about choosing a credit card.\n\nThe best credit cards compared\n\nBest cash-back card Best travel credit card Best card for balance transfers Best card for students Best card for Amazon and Whole Foods shoppers Best card for Apple Pay super users (and privacy enthusiasts)\n\nChase Freedom Unlimited Capital One Venture Card US Bank Visa Platinum Discover it Student Chrome Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card Apple Card Annual fee $0 $95 $0 $0 $0 $0 Credit requirement 670 to 850 720 to 850 680 to 850 No credit history required but you do need proof of income 580 to 850 580 to 850 Purchase APR 14.99% to 23.74% variable 17.24% to 24.49% variable 13.99% to 23.99% variable 12.99% to 21.99% variable (0% intro APR on purchases for the first 6 months) 14.24% to 22.24% variable 12.49% to 23.49% variable\n\nHow should I choose a credit card? Whether you're opening your first card or you've already got excellent credit and are adding to your personal financial arsenal, it's important to first understand the landscape. You need to know what it means when a card has variable APR and be prepared to deal with credit card interest. Learn about the credit card company and what people like and dislike about working with it. You also need to familiarize yourself with your own personal credit and how your card will affect your standing with the credit bureau. And finally, you need to look at reward points, both how you earn them on everyday purchases and how you can cash them in for either gift cards or statement credit.\n\nHow do I qualify for a credit card? The better the benefits, the more hoops you'll need to jump through to be eligible for certain credit cards. Credit cards with attractive rewards programs or cashback rewards require higher credit than more basic credit card varieties. If you have poor or fair credit, you might only qualify for credit builder or secured credit cards. If you have good to excellent credit, you may easily qualify for any credit card you want. But if you don't have the right score, you might not be eligible for the card you wish.\n\nWill having a credit card boost my credit score? When used wisely, credit cards have the opportunity to give your credit score a boost. But not all credit cards report to credit bureaus. If you're looking to build credit, having a card that doesn't report to credit bureaus means your score won't go up for responsible use. For instance, the Apple Card doesn't report to credit bureaus. While this card and others like it might be convenient to use, they're not helping your credit grow. This might not be a bad thing if you have excellent credit, but if you don't, it could hold you back from building yours up.\n\nWhat's the best credit card to get for first-time users? The best credit card for beginners is the one that will help you build credit. You'll also want to determine how you plan to use a credit card. Are you expecting to carry a balance from month to month, or can you reliably pay it off? Are you a student who needs to finance a bunch of back-to-school purchases? Depending on what you need, one credit card issuer might be better than another. But there are some that just tick all the right boxes -- offering more generous terms and conditions, more reward points, a lower interest rate, a higher credit limit, a welcome bonus, fewer fees and more consumer-friendly privacy policies. If you don't yet qualify for a card with the most travel rewards or cash back rates, don't fret. First you'll want to focus on building your credit history with a starter card, and then you can move on to a better card later.\n\nWhat type of credit cards did CNET look at? In 2021, we've evaluated dozens of credit cards and identified the best options across a variety of categories. We've analyzed rewards credit cards -- including those that pay cash back on every purchase, earn you rewards points and miles for all kinds of travel purchases, or focus on one particular airline. We've assessed which credit cards are best for students, optimal for Amazon Prime shoppers and worthwhile for Apple Pay aficionados.\n\nMore personal finance recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

The open-source software has been the engine behind a wide variety of sites -- everything from one-person blogging operations to established media names like Rolling Stone -- for the better part of two decades.\n\nIt's popular with customers because it lets you build a professional custom website using a variety of templates, plug-ins and widgets. The \"catch\" is that anyone outside of a hobbyist will likely want to host a WordPress site on their own domain -- and that means seeking a WordPress host. Similar to choosing a web hosting service in general, finding the right WordPress host can make your life a lot easier. (You may also want to look into a website builder to help you actually create your site on WordPress.)\n\nChoosing a WordPress hosting service can be daunting -- there are so many options that all promise the best customer support, little downtime and a great price, all of which are key for operating your site, whether it's for business or personal use.\n\nHere, we're taking a close look at some of the best WordPress hosting services available, including DreamHost, A2Hosting, GoDaddy Web Hosting and more. We're focusing on commercial WordPress hosting companies that offer virtual private servers, shared hosting and many web hosting services, along with a variety of annual and monthly plans.\n\nHow we chose\n\nGetty/SOPA Images\n\nIt's important to note that we didn't explicitly \"test\" the providers on this list. Instead, we compiled a competitive overview based on a variety of factors, including third-party ratings and features offered by the providers. We've also weighted the rankings of these businesses by the Better Business Bureau and TrustPilot. With that data in hand, we split them into three tiers:\n\nBest WordPress hosting providers (top tier): These vendors all have a rating of A or higher from the Better Business Bureau, and a rating of 3.8 or higher out of 5 from TrustPilot. With the exception of three vendors with between 300 to 400 pieces of user feedback, all of the TrustPilot rankings are based on at least one thousand user reviews. All of the vendors listed in our top picks also say they offer 24/7 support and 99% site uptime or better.\n\nWordPress hosts worth checking out (middle tier): These vendors all have A+ BBB ratings, but not enough TrustPilot reviews for us to consider that rating as impactful, whether it's positive or negative.\n\nOther WordPress hosting options (third tier): Two of these vendors -- MochaHost and Liquid Web Hosting -- currently have F ratings from the BBB. Others have TrustPilot ratings below 3.5, though in three cases, that's from fewer than 500 users.\n\nImportant caveats you should keep in mind: The Better Business Bureau does not rate companies outside of North America, and to be BBB Accredited, companies need to pay a fee to the organization. TrustPilot, meanwhile, also offers a paid tier that provides companies more interaction with their user ratings. It also removed 2.2 million fake reviews in 2020.\n\nSomething else to note: WordPress.org explicitly endorses three hosting sites: Bluehost, DreamHost and SiteGround. The first is not currently on our tier-one list due to a low TrustPilot rating, but may be worth checking out for WordPress specifically. It's also worth noting that, as of April 2020, WordPress cofounder Matt Mullenweg is engaged with a serious war of words with CEO Avishai Abrahami of the website builder Wix. (Note that Mullenweg was a CNET employee in the early 2000s.)\n\nMany of the providers on this list offer similar features but in different packages and price points; once you figure out what type of plan is best for you (for example, one with a certain amount of storage, or with email included) you can more easily compare the options.\n\nIf you want more advice on what to keep in mind while shopping for a web hosting solution, the different types of web hosting available and tips on speeding up your website, make sure you scroll to the bottom of this page.\n\nA note on pricing: We've made every effort to verify that the prices listed here were accurate at the time of last publication. However, prices in this category are subject to frequent fluctuations and they're consistently subject to special offers and limited deals.

Its server and database software is built to be compatible with WordPress for seamless integration. It also offers automatic WordPress updates, easy one-click installs and the proper configurations from the start to help your site run at top speed. DreamHost has provided more than 750,000 WordPress installations, according to its website. DreamHost offers three different WordPress-specific tiers, with different plans within each tier: basic, managed WordPress hosting and virtual private servers for WordPress hosting, giving you different options depending on your needs. It also has a dedicated in-house WordPress customer support team, and 24/7 email and chat support. As noted, DreamHost is recommended by WordPress. Other things we like about Dreamhost: It offers free shared website and email hosting to 501(c)(3) nonprofits. For all others, the pricing is pretty transparent -- there are no hidden gotchas in the rates. Plus, it provides a 97-day money back guarantee, one of the most generous offers available.\n\nSiteGround Basic managed WordPress hosting starting at $7 a month\n\nUnlimited managed WordPress hosting starting at $10 a month\n\nUnlimited managed WordPress hosting with additional features starting at $15 a month SiteGround has an A+ rating from the BBB and 4.7 out of 5 stars on TrustPilot. It sits in the middle ground between a consumer web hosting provider and one that caters to enterprise businesses. If you've got a small business with more complex WordPress needs than a typical small business, SiteGround is an ideal solution -- and if your business ends up expanding, the service has options to grow with you. You've got three different tiers of WordPress hosting plans to choose from: StartUp (one website and 10GB of web space), GrowBig (unlimited websites, 20GB of web space and features like on-demand backup copies and PHP) and GoGeek (unlimited websites, 40GB of web space and several other features, like priority support). SiteGround differs from some other services in that it sets limits on bandwidth and storage up front, whereas most others claim to be unlimited but have rules in the fine print. You'll also get a 30-day money-back guarantee and a 100% renewable energy match. As noted, SiteGround is recommended by WordPress. As is the case with most other services, if you want to get the lowest price, you'll have to pay for a year of service in advance. After that year, the price will go up. Support includes 24/7 live chat and phone access, and tickets that are answered in an average of 15 minutes.\n\nGreenGeeks Basic WordPress hosting starting at $2.49 a month\n\nUnlimited WordPress hosting starting at $5 a month\n\nUnlimited WordPress hosting plus free dedicated IP starting at $9 a month GreenGeeks has an A+ rating from the BBB and 4.1 out of 5 stars on TrustPilot. If you've ever been worried about the tremendous amount of power large data centers consume, you might want to check out this service. The \"green\" in the company's name reflects the Green Geeks' commitment to the environment. It purchases three times the energy it actually uses in wind energy credits, essentially putting energy back into the economy. The company does this through a form of renewable energy certificates, which, while complicated, means that it's not just energy neutral, it's actually helping fuel the green energy economy. Even though it's green, GreenGeeks still offers a lot of power for your WordPress websites. Like other sites, it offers three plans, but with a large amount of web space: Lite (one website and 50GB of web space), Pro (unlimited websites and unlimited web space) and Premium (unlimited websites and web space, plus free premium SSL). All offer a 30-day money back guarantee. GreenGeeks also offers live chat and email support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. It also has phone support most hours of the day. It's also one of the more developer-friendly web hosting providers, too, with multiple PHP versions and Git preinstalled.\n\nGoDaddy Basic WordPress hosting starting at $1 a month for CNET readers\n\nWordPress ecommerce hosting starting at $16 a month GoDaddy has an A+ rating from the BBB and 4.1 out of 5 stars on TrustPilot. While the site is perhaps best known for purchasing domain names, it also offers a variety of WordPress hosting plans. Its basic plan starts at just $1 a month and includes a free SSL Certificate. Or, for larger sites, you can upgrade to the Deluxe plan for $10 a month (with SEO optimization features and 75GB of storage), or the Ultimate plan for $13 a month (with online marketing, unlimited storage and security features). For those who are running larger online shops, GoDaddy also has a WordPress eCommerce plan for $16 a month with no transaction fees, WooCommerce extensions, appointment scheduling and real-time shipping rates. Each plan comes with free business email for the first year. As is the case with many web hosting services, these prices will go up after you renew your service. Make sure you read all the fine print. GoDaddy offers 24/7 phone support and live chat support as well.\n\nBusiness WordPress hosting starting at $1 a month\n\nWordPress Pro (with cloud server) starting at $18 a month IONOS from 1&1 has an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and a TrustPilot score of 4.1 out of 5. It's targeted toward small and medium businesses, with a focus on taking your first steps online or scaling up. IONOS has three typical WordPress plans: Essential for $3 a month (25GB of storage and 10 email accounts), Business for $1 a month (100GB of storage and 100 email accounts) or Unlimited for $8 a month (unlimited storage and email). All plans come with a managed option. Or, you'll find three more WordPress Pro plans, for those who need more intensive support, speed and a dedicated cloud server. As is the case with many other services, the prices listed go up after a year (for example, Essential goes up to $4 a month and Business goes up to $8 a month).\n\nHostPapa WordPress hosting starting at $4 a month HostPapa has an A+ BBB rating and a 4.1 out of 5 TrustPilot rating. It's a small business-focused hosting service that also offers free domain transfer. HostPapa has three WordPress plans: Starter for $4 a month (100GB of storage and 100 email accounts), Business (unlimited storage and email) and Business Pro (unlimited storage and email plus enhanced performance, security and speed). It also offers free WordPress migration.\n\nHostinger WordPress hosting starting at $2 a month Hostinger is based in Lithuania, so it does not have a BBB page (that organization only focuses on US-based businesses). However, it does have a TrustPilot rating of 4.4 out of 5 with more than 2,000 reviews. Hostinger offers four managed WordPress hosting plans: Single WordPress for $2 a month (30GB of storage and one email account), WordPress Starter for $3 a month (100GB of storage and 100 email accounts), Business WordPress for $8 a month (300GB of storage and 100 email accounts) and WordPress Pro for $11.59 a month (all of the above plus additional features for small and medium businesses). Like most other services, these prices go up upon renewal.\n\nA2 Hosting Shared WordPress hosting starting at $3 a month\n\nManaged WordPress hosting starting at $13 a month A2 Hosting has an A+ rating from the BBB and 3.9 out of 5 stars on TrustPilot. You can choose between four shared WordPress hosting plans (ranging in price from $3 a month to $15 a month) or three managed WordPress hosting plans which include faster load times and more security and support (ranging in price from $13 a month to $44 a month). Customer support is also strong: A2 Hosting's Guru Grew support team is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year by phone, email, online chat or ticket. Like most web hosting providers, the published pricing is a bit misleading: The shared hosting price tag of $3 a month is only available if you sign up for the three-year plan and pay upfront. It offers a 30-day money back guarantee or a prorated refund for unused service after that point.\n\nHostWinds WordPress hosting starting at $5.24 a month Hostwinds has an A rating from the BBB and a 3.9 out of 5 stars from TrustPilot. It offers three WordPress hosting sites, ranging in price from $5.24 a month to $8.24 a month. All plans offer unlimited bandwidth, disk space, email accounts, dedicated IPs and SSL certificates. Other perks include free WordPress site migration, and use of the Weebly site builder.\n\nAdditional WordPress hosting options worth checking out\n\nThe following WordPress hosts have slightly lower or fewer TrustPilot ratings than the ones above, but almost all are still highly rated with the BBB.\n\nWebHostingPad\n\nWebHosingPad has an A+ BBB rating, but just a handful of reviews on TrustPilot. Its \"all-inclusive\" website hosting plan starts at $2 a month and includes free SSL certificates, a free website builder by Weebly, one-click install WordPress, a free domain and a 30-day money-back guarantee. It also offers unlimited websites, domains and email. WebHostingPad offers fewer services than some of the other providers, but the all-inclusive approach may be appealing if you want a simple way to get started building and hosting a site.\n\nAccuWeb Hosting\n\n\n\nAccuWeb Hosting has an A+ rating from the BBB and 4 out of 5 stars from TrustPilot, but again, fewer than 100 reviews. It stands out due to the wide array of hosting options it offers, including several different managed and unmanaged Windows and Linux hosting plans. AccuWeb Hosting also breaks down what's included in each plan more clearly than some of the other providers.\n\nWeb Hosting Hub\n\nWeb Hosting Hub has an A+ BBB rating, but it has yet to have a quorum of user reviews on TrustPilot. One standout feature is full service web design for an extra fee, so you don't have to build your site yourself.\n\nWP Engine Web Hosting\n\nWP Engine Web Hosting has a A BBB rating and a 3.4 out of 5 TrustPilot rating (but with fewer than 200 reviews). As the name suggests, it's a WordPress hosting option that works with several large brands, including Yelp, Marriott and Etsy.\n\nGlowHost\n\nGlowHost has an A+ BBB rating, but just a small handful of TrustPilot reviews. If you want to give it a try, the service offers a 91-day money-back guarantee.\n\nOther WordPress hosting options\n\nThe following WordPress hosts have more mixed reviews and either a low BBB or TrustPilot rating. Reminder that we haven't tested them ourselves, but would recommend doing more research before signing up. And again, Bluehost is one of only three hosting sites that WordPress.org explicitly endorses, so may be worth checking out for this purpose.\n\nBluehost: A+ BBB rating, 2.6 TrustPilot rating\n\nHostGator: A+ BBB rating, 3.3 TrustPilot rating\n\nInMotion Hosting: A+ BBB rating, 3.3 TrustPilot rating (fewer than 500 reviews)\n\niPage: A+ BBB rating, 1.4 TrustPilot rating (fewer than 500 reviews)\n\nLiquid Web Hosting: F BBB rating, 4.5 TrustPilot rating (fewer than 500 reviews)\n\n: F BBB rating, 4.4 TrustPilot rating\n\nPlanning your WordPress hosting purchase\n\nNow that you've got a lay of the land for what types of web hosting services are out there, here are a few tips for when it comes to actually choosing a plan.\n\nBe wary of the 'starting price'\n\nDespite the fact that most WordPress hosting services typically list a low starting price, this price will usually require you to pay up front for two to three years of service -- so it's not really, say, $3 a month, but $72 in advance for two years. And once that promotional period is over, the price to renew your service can end up being way higher.\n\nSwitching providers? Look for free site migrations\n\nIf your WordPress hosting agreement is about to run out and the price is going to go up, you may want to transfer your site to another hosting provider to take advantage of their introductory deal. Look for those providers that offer free or low-cost site migrations to do so.\n\nOne more note about migration services: While these are useful, they're often automated, which means not everything may migrate over, and you may have to make some changes. Make sure you research how it will work for you before you sign up.\n\nRead the fine print on 'unlimited' services\n\nWhile many web hosting services offer what they call \"unlimited\" or unmetered service for a certain amount of bandwidth, disk storage and websites you use, make sure you read the terms of service. Most actually do include a definition with a limit for use. But if you're running a fairly basic site and aren't trying to take advantage of the system, you should be fine.\n\nMake sure you know the difference between web hosting and web building services\n\nMany web hosting services also offer a drag-and-drop website builder, helping you get your site up and running. But make sure you read the fine print: Using one of these website builders will often lock you into the web hosting service, too. The builders may also be proprietary to the service, making it difficult to move your site to another service if you want to do so later on.\n\nMore expert web tips"}]

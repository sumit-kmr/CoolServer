It is unclear how many have signed, and the DUP said it would not comment on internal party matters.\n\nThe move against Foster, who has led the party since 2015, is the latest sign of how Britain's economic split from the European Union at the end of 2020 has shaken the political balance in Northern Ireland, a part of the U.K. where some people identify as British and some as Irish.\n\nPost-Brexit trade rules have imposed customs and border checks on some goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. The arrangement was designed to avoid checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, an EU member, because an open Irish border has helped underpin the peace process that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe new arrangements have angered Northern Ireland's British unionists, who say the new checks amount to a border in the Irish Sea and weaken ties with the rest of the UK.\n\nTensions over the new rules were a contributing factor to a week of street violence in Northern Ireland cities earlier this month that saw youths pelt police with bricks, fireworks and petrol bombs.\n\nFoster and other prominent DUP politicians are facing the wrath of party members for backing the divorce agreement that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck with the EU.\n\nFoster also has alienated sections of the conservative, Protestant party by taking a too-liberal stand on social issues.

who helped pinpoint Osama bin Laden", "Article's Text": "File photo: People gather outside the hideout of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden following his death by US Special Forces in a ground operation in Abbottabad.\n\nISLAMABAD: Dismissed as a traitor in Pakistan but lauded as a hero by the United States, Shakeel Afridi is paying a heavy price for his role in bringing an end to Osama bin Laden .\n\nA decade after the al-Qaida chief was gunned down by a team of Navy Seals , there is no sign the doctor will be exonerated by Pakistan authorities for helping the CIA pinpoint Laden's location under the cloak of running a vaccination programme.\n\nLocked up in solitary confinement in Sahiwal Jail in Pakistan's central Punjab province, Afridi now spends his time counting the days -- with nothing to differentiate between them.\n\n\"He is being kept in prison now only to teach every Pakistani a lesson not to cooperate with a western intelligence agency,\" Husain Haqqani, who was serving as Pakistan's ambassador to Washington at the time of the raid, told AFP.\n\n\"Instead of coming clean on bin Laden's presence in Pakistan, the authorities have made Dr Afridi a scapegoat.\"\n\nAFP pieced together the daily routine of the doctor through interviews with his brother and lawyer, as Afridi is barred from speaking to anyone apart from his family or legal team.\n\nFor exercise, he paces around his seven by eight foot cell and does occasional push-ups, according to his family.\n\nHe has a copy of the Koran, but is not allowed other books.\n\nA couple of times a week he shaves in the presence of a guard, but contact with other inmates is also strictly prohibited.\n\nFamily members can visit just twice a month, but are separated by an iron grate and forbidden from conversing in their native Pashto tongue.\n\n\"The prison authorities have told us that we can't discuss politics or talk about the situation inside the jail,\" said the brother.\n\nHailing from Pakistan's rugged tribal areas, the physician appeared to be an ideal asset for the CIA as the spy agency zeroed in on Bin Laden's hideout in the city of Abbottabad.\n\nAll the Americans needed was a bit of proof that bin Laden was there, so they had Afridi launch a vaccine campaign with the aim of extracting a DNA sample from inside his compound.\n\nJust how instrumental Afridi was in identifying the al-Qaida boss is unclear, but the doctor was arrested by authorities weeks after the deadly assault on bin Laden's home.\n\nHe was never found guilty of anything linked to the raid, but convicted by a tribal court under an obscure colonial era law of providing money to an insurgent group and handed a 33-year sentence.\n\nSuccessive US administrations have protested against his continued imprisonment -- and over the years there has been talk of a prisoner exchange -- but a deal to free Afridi has never materialised.\n\n\"Let's be clear: Afridi has paid the highest price,\" said Michael Kugelman, deputy South Asia director at the Wilson Center in Washington.\n\n\"He became the fall guy.\"\n\nThe 10-year anniversary of the bin Laden raid comes just weeks after President Joe Biden announced that the US's long war in Afghanistan would be coming to an end.\n\nIn an address to the nation, Biden citied the killing of bin Laden as proof that US forces had long ago accomplished their initial objectives for invading Afghanistan.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the president made no mention of Afridi.\n\n\"The withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the downgrading of ties with Pakistan that this could entail, suggests that Afridi won't be the hot button issue that it's been in the past,\" said Kugelman.\n\nFew are sympathetic to Afridi's ongoing plight in Pakistan, where the bin Laden raid fanned anti-American sentiment after years of simmering distrust between the uneasy allies.\n\n\"Whenever someone works for a foreign intelligence agency it's one of the most unforgivable crimes,\" Asad Durrani, the former head of Pakistan's formidable spy agency, told AFP, saying that Afridi's arrest probably saved the doctor from being lynched.\n\nBut even as the US prepares to exit Afghanistan and memories of the bin Laden saga fade, Afridi's legacy continues to reverberate in Pakistan.\n\nFaith in vaccine campaigns has been seriously undercut by the ruse, with families routinely refusing to have their children inoculated for curable diseases such as polio.\n\nInsurgents have also attacked vaccine teams, with dozens of health workers gunned down in the past decade.\n\nMeanwhile in prison, Afridi remains largely cut off from the outside world and passes his time pacing his cell and reciting daily prayers.\n\n\"He is not allowed to use a mobile, read a newspaper or a book,\" said his brother Jamil Afridi.\n\n\"He lives in isolation.\"\n\n"}, {"Article Image":

But it said they were part of efforts to resolve tensions.\n\n\"France, also affected by terrorism, understands the absolute necessity of providing justice for victims,\" a statement said. \"With this transfer, it is also part of the urgent need to build a Europe of justice in which mutual confidence must be at the centre.\"\n\nOfficials in France said the arrests followed months of discussions between the two countries.\n\nSince taking office in February, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has established a close working relationship with French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nWhy has France acted now?\n\nThe Mitterrand doctrine meant that ex-Red Brigaders would not be troubled by French police as long as they were now leading ordinary, innocent lives.\n\nCrucially, and this bit is often forgotten, President Mitterrand also said this rule should not apply to members who the Italian authorities could show had blood on their hands. Suspected killers would not be protected, but extradited to face justice.\n\nIn practice this never, or rarely, happened. Only two former members of the Red Brigades have been sent back. One of them, Cesare Battisti, fled to South America in 2004 before he could be handed over. His eventual extradition to Italy was from Bolivia.\n\nOne reason for this was the strong support for the militants in France's left-wing intelligentsia. Another was the claim that the Italian justice system would not treat them fairly. The Italians were obviously furious.\n\nToday, because the original intention was always, in theory, to send back to Italy the worst alleged offenders, President Macron can argue that he's not actually breaking with the Mitterrand doctrine. But he is certainly breaking with precedent.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nItalian Justice Minister Marta Cartabia hailed a \"historic\" action.\n\nForeign Minister Luigi Di Maio said the arrests proved that \"one cannot run away from one's responsibilities, from the pain inflicted, the harm caused\".\n\nBut the lawyer for five of the detainees called the arrests an \"unspeakable betrayal on France's part\".\n\n\"Since the 1980s, these people have been under the protection of France.

In cases where the immune response was weaker, it remained sufficient, he said, without providing exact figures.\n\nAsked about the new variant first detected in India, Mr. Sahin said the vaccine's effectiveness against it was still being investigated.\n\n\u201cBut the Indian variant has mutations that we have previously investigated and against which our vaccine also works, so I am confident there, too,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Mainz-based company's work developing a vaccine based on messenger RNA, or mRNA, benefited from its earlier research into pharmaceuticals to treat cancer, as tumors often try to adapt to evade the immune system, Mr. Sahin said.\n\n\u201cThe way our vaccine works is that it has two points of attack,\u201d he explained.

Doug Ducey has signed a sweeping anti-abortion bill that bans the procedure if the woman is seeking it solely because a fetus has a genetic abnormality such as Down syndrome.\n\nDoctors who perform an abortion solely because the child has a survivable genetic issue can face felony charges. The proposal also contains a raft of other provisions sought by abortion opponents.\n\nThe measure passed the Republican-controlled Legislature on party-line votes over unanimous opposition from minority Democrats. The Republican governor is an abortion opponent who has never vetoed a piece of anti-abortion legislation.\n\nSenate Bill 1457 moved through the Legislature in fits and starts, stalling twice before moving again amid intense pressure by abortion opponents on GOP lawmakers who opposed some of its provisions. It finally passed both chambers last week.\n\nThe abortion bill as originally written made it a felony for a doctor to perform the procedure because the fetus has a genetic abnormality such as Down syndrome, and contained a slew of other provisions, including one that confers all civil rights to unborn children. Democrats call that \u201cpersonhood\u201d provision a backdoor way to allow criminal charges against a woman who has an abortion.\n\nIn addition to the ban on abortions for genetic abnormalities and the \u201cpersonhood\u201d provision, the bill bans mail delivery of abortion-inducing medication, allows the father or maternal grandparents of a fetus aborted because of a genetic issue to sue, and bans the spending of any state money toward organisations that provide abortion care.\n\nThe measure also requires fetal remains to be buried or cremated, and it forbids state universities from providing abortion care.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s immeasurable value in every single life \u2014 regardless of genetic makeup,\u201d Mr. Ducey said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe will continue to prioritise protecting life in our preborn children, and this legislation goes a long way in protecting real human lives.\u201d\n\nThe bill was amended twice to allay the concerns of a pair of Republicans \u2014 one worried that a woman would be forced to carry a fetus that could not survive and a second concerned that a doctors\u2019 medical decisions could be overruled by a jury.\n\nThat GOP-backed amendment also clarified that the \u201cpersonhood\u201d provision does not ban in-vitro fertilisation.\n\nThe Democrats issued a lengthy written rebuttal to the bill after the final amendment.\n\nThe measure was a top priority for the social conservative group Center for Arizona Policy. Its president, Cathi Herrod, routinely backs anti-abortion bills in the Legislature. National anti-abortion groups hailed its passage.\n\nMinutes after the governor acted, Ms. Herrod sent out a news release with the subject line \u201cLife Wins!\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, Arizonans win. Arizona children diagnosed with disabilities prior to birth will no longer be discriminated against,\u201d Ms. Herrod wrote in the release. \u201cArizona women will be ensured common-sense safeguards if they choose the abortion pill. Arizona taxpayers will not be forced to support abortions at public colleges and universities, and the laws of Arizona will be interpreted to value all human life.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights groups had rallied at the Capitol on Monday, urging Mr. Ducey to veto the measure and presenting him with petitions signed by opponents of the bill.\n\nDemocrats lamented the governor\u2019s action, including Rep.

On Monday, India broke the world record for daily coronavirus infections for a fifth consecutive day, reporting nearly 353,000 new cases. And it added 2,812 deaths to its overall toll of more than 195,000, which experts say is likely to be a vast undercount.\n\n\u201cThe crisis in India is a humanitarian disaster unfolding before our eyes,\u201d said Tom Hart, the acting chief executive of the ONE campaign, a nonprofit dedicated to eradicating world poverty. Based on an analysis of contracts signed by Mr. Biden\u2019s most recent predecessor, the group estimates that the federal government has secured 550 million more doses than it needs to cover every American.\n\nWith worrisome variants spreading in the United States and around the world, public health experts say vaccinating people overseas is not only a moral imperative, but it is essential to protecting Americans. J. Stephen Morrison, the director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Mr. Biden needed to offer a more sweeping vision of how the United States can help the world.\n\n\u201cWe are approaching these colossal, complex problems in an ad hoc, reactive, short-term manner,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. He called the announcement on Monday a \u201cfurther incremental step by the Biden administration toward fuller engagement internationally to address the dire vaccine gap.\u201d\n\nOn a conference call with reporters on Monday, senior Biden administration officials said that in addition to the money pledged to the international vaccine initiative, known as Covax, the administration intended to spend $11.5 billion, appropriated by Congress as part of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, on helping other countries fight the pandemic and administer vaccines."}, {"Article Image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/21/multimedia/00xp-jane-austen-1/merlin_90406354_3e65ecb7-7f9c-4b6a-80be-332d5fb878d7-facebookJumbo.jpg", "Article's Title": "A Jane Austen Museum Wants to Discuss Slavery.

The point that Bill Gates made about manufacturing capacity being restricted is absolutely correct. But what I said is why not have a global fund, USD25 billion, to help with manufacturing capacity and then allow the vaccine recipes to be shared.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have a lack of quality control. I think it is patronising to say that 100 other nations can\u2019t have a regulatory process to make sure that manufacturing is safe. They can and the World Health Organization can,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cNo one is asking Pfizer to manufacture these vaccines, no one is saying they need to do it for free. It\u2019s important to understand, they will get paid. They will be able to sell it. The reason they\u2019re not doing it would be pure greed,\u201d Khanna said.\n\nThe United States government gave a USD2 billion guarantee to Pfizer to purchase vaccines.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for that, Pfizer would have never been able to do what they did. Our NIH gave the IP that allowed Moderna to develop the vaccine,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re now saying is that they should share the vaccine recipe with over 100 countries who want to do the manufacturing. They\u2019re willing to do the manufacturing themselves, they need to have contract manufacturing. Pfizer would still get paid. Moderna would still get paid. But it is just wrong, morally wrong, strategically wrong for them not to share the vaccine recipe, which was developed with US taxpayer support,\u201d Khanna further said.\n\nHe applauded Biden for committing to help India in its fight against the virus.\n\n\u201cBut we also ultimately need to get vaccines to India. The president has said that he will release the AstraZeneca vaccine, which Americans are not going to use after it\u2019s deemed safe.

The military has cracked down with lethal force on the protesters, killing more than 750 people, an activist group says.\n\nReuters is unable to confirm the casualties as the junta has clamped down on media freedoms and journalists are among the many people who have been detained.\n\nAlarmed by the turmoil in one of its members, ASEAN held a meeting on Saturday in the Indonesian capital with the leader of the junta in a bid to press him to end the crisis.\n\nASEAN did not invite a representative of Suu Kyi\u2019s ousted government.\n\nASEAN leaders said after the meeting they had reached a \u201cfive-point consensus\u201d on steps to end violence and promote dialogue between the rival Myanmar sides.\n\nBut the junta later said it would give \u201ccareful consideration\u201d to ASEAN\u2019s suggestions, which included appointing an envoy to visit Myanmar, \u201cwhen the situation returns to stability\u201d and provided that ASEAN\u2019s recommendations facilitated the junta\u2019s own roadmap and served the country\u2019s interests.\n\nActivists had earlier criticised the plan, saying it helped to legitimise the junta and fell far short of their demands.\n\nIn particular, it did not call for the release of Suu Kyi, 75, and other political prisoners.

Masks are still necessary in crowded outdoor venues like sports stadiums, the CDC said.\n\nBut President Joe Biden hailed it as a landmark moment in the pandemic, wearing a mask as he approached the lectern on a warm spring day on the White House grounds \u2014 and pointedly keeping it off as he walked back into the White House when he was done.\n\n\u201cGo get the shot. It\u2019s never been easier,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd once you\u2019re fully vaccinated, you can go without a mask when you\u2019re outside and away from big crowds.\u201d\n\nThe CDC stopped short of telling even fully vaccinated people that they could shed their masks outdoors altogether \u2014 citing the worrying risk that remains for transmitting the coronavirus, unknown vaccination levels among people in crowds and the still-high caseloads in some regions of the country. The guidance also cautioned even vaccinated people against going without masks in medium-size outdoor gatherings.\n\nBut even the CDC\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, emphasized a more expansive interpretation, telling reporters at a White House briefing, \u201cWe no longer feel that the vaccinated people require masks outdoors,\u201d outside \u201clarge public venues, such as concerts, stadiums and things like that.\u201d\n\nThe order had immediate ripple effects in the states. Governors in California, New York, Louisiana, Maine and Massachusetts all relaxed outdoor mask mandates after the CDC\u2019s announcement. In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, went much further, ignoring the federal government\u2019s advice as he declared it was \u201ctime for celebrations and weddings and conventions and concerts and parades and proms\u201d to take place \u201cwithout limits on gathering sizes.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, a group of Republican lawmakers who are also medical professionals released an advertisement Tuesday encouraging vaccination, in which they appeared wearing white coats with stethoscopes draped around their necks. Sen. Roger Marshall, a freshman Republican from Kansas and a medical doctor, told viewers that the reason to get vaccinated was simple: \u201cSo we can throw away our masks, and live life as free as before.\u201d\n\nMarshall, who organized the effort, said it was based on research conducted by Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster working to reduce vaccine hesitancy among conservatives. In an interview, Luntz said Biden\u2019s announcement was a positive step, and could give people who are reluctant to get vaccinated a reason to get their shots.\n\n\u201cIt gives them a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Tell me when I can get rid of my mask\u2019 is actually the language that they use, so the fact that this is a meaningful, measurable step toward returning to normal is a big deal.\u201d\n\nAlso from NYT | Millions of Americans are skipping their second doses of COVID vaccines\n\nFor Biden, who will address Congress on Wednesday and mark his 100th day in office Thursday, the CDC\u2019s announcement was a moment to bask in what he called the \u201cstunning progress\u201d Americans had made since he took office. Next week, he said, he will outline a plan \u201cto get us to July 4 as our target date to get life in America closer to normal and begin to celebrate our independence from the virus.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines issued Tuesday reflect some basic coronavirus math: As the number of vaccinated people goes up, cases are going down.\n\nSo far, about 43% of Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 29% have received both doses of the two vaccines requiring double shots. The United States is averaging around 55,000 new cases a day, a roughly 20% drop from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times database.\n\n\u201cI know the quarantine and shutdowns throughout the pandemic have been exhausting,\u201d Walensky said. \u201cI know we all miss the things we used to do before the pandemic, and I know we all want to do the things we love and soon. Today is another day we can take a step back to the normalcy of before.\u201d\n\nHer remarks, and those of the president, got a welcome reception even from some of the Biden administration\u2019s fiercest Republican critics in Congress, many of whom have complained that coronavirus restrictions were an intrusion on their personal freedoms.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who quit wearing masks indoors after he was vaccinated, said he was \u201cglad the CDC finally acknowledged what has been obvious for a long time, which is that wearing a mask outside is silly and not remotely justified by the science.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the science behind the CDC\u2019s new guidance is not comprehensive. A growing body of research indicates that the odds of the virus spreading outdoors is far lower than it is indoors, but the risk is not zero and is hard to quantify.\n\nMost if not all of the research about viral transmission outside was done before the vaccine was available, so it does not distinguish between the risk to those who are inoculated and those who are not.\n\nBut experts say that viral particles disperse quickly outdoors, meaning brief encounters with a passing walker or jogger pose very little risk of transmission.\n\n\u201cThe two main things you have going for you outdoors is that the virus rapidly becomes diluted\u201d and decays quickly in the sunlight, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech, adding, \u201cI think something like sitting at a baseball game where people are really cheek by jowl, side by side, and in front and behind each other, and there\u2019s yelling, cheering \u2014 I would wear a mask in that situation.\u201d\n\nOne of the paper\u2019s authors, Dr. Nooshin Razani, an associate adjunct professor in epidemiology, biostatistics and pediatrics at University of California, San Francisco, cautioned that the low odds of transmission outdoors may simply reflect the fact that people spend little time outdoors.\n\nIn one documented case in Italy, the virus spread between joggers who were running outdoors together, side by side.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s new guidance was issued amid growing debate over why the federal government was still recommending that people wear masks outdoors. Writing in The New England Journal of Medicine last week, Dr. Paul Sax, an infectious disease expert at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts, said it was time to end outdoor mask mandates.\n\nAlong with the guidelines, the CDC published a color-coded chart outlining masking recommendations for a variety of scenarios such as, \u201cdine at an outdoor restaurant with friends from multiple households,\u201d \u201cvisit a barber or hair salon\u201d and \u201cgo to an uncrowded, indoor shopping center or museum.\u201d\n\nBut Marr said that seemed overly complex: \u201cI would have to carry around a sheet of paper \u2014 a cheat sheet with all these different stipulations.\u201d She added: \u201cI worry that this is not as helpful as it could be.\u201d"}, {"Article Image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-10/jf03rmsg_samsung-chairman-lee-kunhee650_625x300_25_October_20.jpg", "Article's Title": "Samsung's Lee Family To Pay More Than 12 Trillion Won Inheritance Taxes", "Article's Text": "Lee Kun-hee's estate included shareholdings in Samsung affiliates valued at $17 billion.\n\nThe family of deceased Samsung Electronics chairman Lee Kun-hee said on Wednesday it will pay more than 12 trillion won ($10.78 billion) in inheritance taxes for the estate of the late patriarch.\n\nLee, who is credited with transforming Samsung into the world's largest smartphone and memory chip maker, died on Oct. 25.

But the most recent data was looking at convalescent sera of COVID-19 cases in people who received the vaccine used in India, the Covaxin. And it was found to neutralise the 617 variant,\" he said, according to news agency PTI.\n\n\"So despite the real difficulty that we're seeing in India, vaccination could be a very, very important antidote against this,\" Dr Fauci was quoted as telling reporters.\n\n\"So I'll stop there with the final statement. The one thing you can gather from everything I've said: that it's very important to get vaccinated.\"\n\nCovaxin was developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and was approved for emergency use on January 3 while still in clinical trial.\n\nTrial results later showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78 per cent, according to ICMR.\n\nThe B.1.617 variant, mostly found in Covid cases in Maharashtra and Delhi, has three new spike protein mutations. This variant is said to be pushing the deadly second surge in Covid across the country.\n\nCovaxin uses dead viruses and works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the coronavirus. When Covaxin is administered, immune cells recognise the dead virus, prompting the immune system to make antibodies to fight the coronavirus.\n\nWHO on Tuesday said the B.1.617 that a variant of Covid-19 feared to be contributing to a surge in coronavirus cases in India has been found in over a dozen countries.\n\nThe UN health agency said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 first found in India had as of Tuesday been detected in over 1,200 sequences uploaded to the GISAID open-access database \"from at least 17 countries\".\n\n\"Most sequences were uploaded from India, the United Kingdom, USA and Singapore,\" the WHO said in its weekly epidemiological update on the pandemic.\n\nThe WHO recently listed B.1.617 as a \"variant of interest\" and said it had been found in 17 countries.\n\nIndia's Covid cases smashed a new record today with 3.6 lakh cases and over 3,000 deaths in 24 hours."}]

There are other examples of industries being affected by the oxygen shortage. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., the nation\u2019s biggest carmaker, said it is shutting its plant for maintenance to divert supplies to hospitals, while India\u2019s steel output may decline as more and more steelmakers divert their oxygen stocks for medical purposes.\n\nThe delivery of vessels for scrapping had already been heavily curbed as various countries banned seafarers from traveling to and from India. This may negatively impact the buying and selling of ships, resulting in constrained supply of carriers for recycling, Sharma said.\n\nAvailability of carriers for scrapping had anyway declined in recent months amid high freight rates in several shipping sectors. Only 43 ships were recycled at Alang, India in the first quarter of 2021, a 27% drop from the same period last year, according to GMS.\n\n\u201cProfitability for the ship-recycling industry won\u2019t go down, as steel fundamentals are strong,\" Sharma said. \u201cOxygen shortages in India should ease in a few weeks with an acceleration in the setup of production plants, but supply of ships may be limited.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/b17bd1da-9ea9-11eb-aa67-d1e615859831_1618662706131_1619616690410.jpg", "Article's Title": "PM Modi speaks to Russian President Vladimir Putin, discusses Covid-19 situation", "Article's Text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday to discuss Covid situation.

In the scenario, IATO has urged immediate removal of these anomalies and release of Service Export Incentive Scheme (SEIS) as these measures would provide the sector with much needed relief.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/f4c300d0-a58e-11eb-a6ca-1ce56e8b7c0c_1619617415568_1619617447052.jpg", "Article's Title": "HC appeals to citizens not to hoard oxygen cylinders, COVID-19 medicines", "Article's Text": "\ufeffNew Delhi: The Delhi High Court Wednesday appealed to citizens not to hoard oxygen cylinders and medicines required for COVID-19 patients so as to avoid creating artificial scarcity and make them available to people in need.\n\nA bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, which heard the matter for four hours, appointed senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao as amicus curiae to assist the court deal with medical oxygen crisis and other issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe bench also asked the Delhi government to examine the suggestion for taking services of armed forces in this situation as they can set up field hospitals which will help a large number of COVID-19 patients in the national capital and take appropriate steps.\n\nIt also asked the state government to place report on the number of RT-PCR tests conducted in last seven days and the reasons for reduction in the tests.\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/AP04_28_2021_000091B_1619615143188_1619615252859.jpg", "Article's Title": "256 oxygen concentrators arrive at Mumbai airport from Singapore", "Article's Text": "Mumbai: As many 256 oxygen concentrators have arrived at the City's Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) from Singapore amid an acute shortage of medical oxygen in the wake of huge spike in Covid-19 cases in the country, the private airport operator said on Wednesday.\n\nThe oxygen concentrators weighing approximately 5.5 tonnes, landed in two tranches with each consisting of 128 concentrators in the last two days, it said.\n\nThe medical device concentrates oxygen from ambient air and is particularly helpful for patients who are isolating at home as well as for meeting the demands of hospitals running low on oxygen.\n\nAs India receives global support to combat the second wave of Covid-19, the first shipment of oxygen concentrators landed in Mumbai at 9.52 PM on Tuesday followed by another one, which arrived at 10.10 AM on Wednesday, CSMIA said.\n\nThe offloading of these shipments was given topmost priority and the entire process was completed in a span of 15 minutes, the airport operator said.\n\nThe recent spike in cases has led to an increase in demand for oxygen across the country.\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/E0DP18fVIAUtvcs_1619603369381_1619603378582.jfif", "Article's Title": "PM Modi reviews Covid-related operations by IAF, stresses on speed, safety in transporting oxygen", "Article's Text": "Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.

The B.1.617 variant has three new spike protein mutations. Two mutations -- E484Q and L452R -- are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation. The third mutation -- P681R -- allows the virus to enter cells a little better.\n\nThe WHO said that globally, new COVID-19 cases increased for the ninth consecutive week, with nearly 5.7 million new cases reported in the last week.

In about a week, we will find out whether the ruling Trinamool Congress can hold on to power for another five years, or the BJP will pull off a surprise, or the Left Front, now in an alliance with their erstwhile main rival, the Congress, will recover even some of the ground they have dramatically lost.\n\nElectoral campaigns have revolved around the record of the ruling Trinamool, which has now governed for a decade. The BJP is running on the electoral plank of \"real change,\" promising growth and jobs, while the Trinamool is pushing back with its record of setting up various welfare schemes; the Left Alliance has been highlighting the economic hardships faced by ordinary citizens, especially the poor. Given that 72% of people in the state live in rural areas, what is happening to the economy of rural Bengal could play a major role in the electoral outcome. With this in mind, let us briefly review West Bengal's economic performance over the last few decades based on official data reported in various RBI handbooks - both over time and relative to India - with special focus on the rural sector.\n\nAs is well known, until the early 1960s, West Bengal's per capita income was higher than the national average. In fact, it was among the three richest states - the other two being Maharashtra and Gujarat. By the early 1980s, its per capita income was just about equal to the national average. In the early 1990s, when the country was poised to move to a higher growth trajectory, the rank of West Bengal fell to seven. In 2000, it fell further to 10, and in 2011, when a new government came to power promising change, its rank was 11. After a decade under the new regime, the slide has continued - its rank now stands at 14.\n\nClearly, this long-term snapshot of the state falling behind in economic terms, relative to the rest of the country over the decades, reflects an overall growth trajectory that has not kept up with the national average. And indeed, the marginal decline in its rank over the last decade relative to the previous one shows that there has not been any paribartan or change in this respect. However, if we take a more granular view of the growth process in West Bengal, some interesting features begin to emerge.\n\nTo begin with, West Bengal has performed better in agricultural growth over the last decade compared to the rest of the country. And in this respect, its record is better than the decade before. Even though its share of agriculture and related activities is comparable to and slightly higher than the nationwide average, the growth rate of agriculture in West Bengal has been 3.3% over the last decade (2011-12 to 2019-20), while that of India has been 1.6%. This seems to be largely driven by the fall in the growth rate of agriculture in the country over the last five years, because if we just look at the first five years of the last decade, the all-India agricultural growth rate was higher than that of West Bengal. Interestingly, during the earlier decade (1999-2000 to 2009-2010), when the state was still under the rule of the Left Front, the state's growth rate in agriculture was very similar to (though marginally higher than) that of the country, while its overall growth rate was lower than that the national average. Of course, West Bengal's higher growth rate in agriculture in the last decade implies that the growth rate of manufacturing as well as services in the state were lower than the countrywide average, given that the overall growth rate was lower in the state (4.2%) relative to the rest of the country (5.2%).\n\nThis basic aspect of West Bengal's growth performance shows up in some other statistics as well. While the overall rural unemployment rate went up in West Bengal and nationwide between 2011-12 and 2018-19, the extent of the overall increase for India (1.7% to 5%) was much higher than the rise in the state (2.7% to 3.5%). Noticeably, however, the rural female unemployment rate went down in the state (2.4% to 1.4%) while it went up in the country as a whole (1.7% to 3.5%) over the same period.\n\nNow, given how state and national income statistics are estimated, we do not get a very reliable picture of what is happening in the informal economy. For this reason, data on consumer expenditure, based on household surveys, provide a valuable glimpse into what is happening to living standards. Earlier, the National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) used to publish periodic reports on monthly per capita expenditure in rural and urban areas. Unfortunately, the report from the latest round (2017-18) was released, but later withdrawn. Still, comparing the numbers from this round with the previous round (2011-12) offers some interesting insights. After adjusting for inflation, the rate of growth of per capita consumption expenditure in urban areas in the state (3.8%) over the last decade fell short of that of the country as a whole (4.7%). However, for rural areas, the pattern reverses itself - over the last decade, West Bengal's growth rate shot up to 5%, well above the national average of 3%. This is also reflected in calculations that show that the percentage of people below the poverty line went down from 20% in 2011-12 to 14% in 2017-18 in West Bengal, while in the country as a whole it went up marginally from 22% to 23%. These numbers are consistent with the higher rate of agricultural growth in the state that we mentioned earlier.\n\nThere are many things in the electoral mix, from the various transfer programmes of the state government to perceptions of corruption, mismanagement, and political repression against the current regime as well as social issues based on caste, religion, and immigration. The chaos and misery unleashed up by Covid-19, as well as Cyclone Amphan, all in the last twelve months, have introduced a degree of unpredictability. However, the fact that the rural economy in the state over the last decade has outperformed the national average, a fact that has almost gone unnoticed, might end up playing an important role.\n\n(Maitreesh Ghatak is Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and an elected Fellow of the British Academy.)\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

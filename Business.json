There could even be up to 5 per cent discount on the purchase of a new vehicle if a scrap certificate is produced.\n\nIn addition, it also offers a 25 per cent discount in road tax, among others. It also proposes to de-register vehicles that fail fitness tests or are unable to renew registrations after 15-20 years of use.\n\nAccording to Crisil, in the bus segment, many buses owned by state transport undertakings will have a life of over 15 years. In comparison, buses operated for intercity, staff, school and tourist segments typically do not have a life beyond 15 years, and would thus be outside the ambit of the scrappage policy.\n\nCrisil Research estimates that around 45,000 buses, largely owned by STCs, could be scrapped and replaced, it said.\n\nAssuming a three-year window, starting April 2022, scrappage of around 15,000 buses annually could result in 15-20 per cent incremental new bus sales \u2013 based on the average of around 90,000 buses sold between fiscals 2016 and 2020.\n\nThis, however, would depend on the state government's wherewithal to purchase new vehicles and therefore will be a monitorable, Crisil Research said.\n\nAs for the passenger vehicles, renewal of registration fees is proposed to increase from Rs 600 to Rs 5,000 (valid for five years) for PVs older than 15 years, a hike of over eight times.\n\nHowever, these vehicles mostly ply in the rural areas where enforcement of higher registration fees is difficult to monitor. The potential benefit from scrapping a 15-year-old, entry-level small car will be Rs 70,000, whereas its resale value is around Rs 95,000. That makes scrapping unattractive, said the report.\n\nBut for vehicles older than 20 years, considering that there is a proposal to deregister them, the potential scrappage benefit is around Rs 50,000, which is similar to its resale value. That can incentivise scrapping, the report stated, adding as a result, 40,000-60,000 PVs can realistically be scrapped.\n\nTherefore, the incremental contribution to new vehicle sales works out to 12,000 to 20,000 PVs annually, assuming a three-year window. As the number is less than 1 per cent of the 30 lakh units sold on average over fiscals 2016-2020, scrapping will not contribute substantially to new sales, said the report.\n\nIn the case of two-wheelers, according to the report, while the fees for renewal of registration is proposed to increase from Rs 300 to Rs 1,000 (valid for five years) for vehicles older than 15 years, the cost burden in absolute terms is minimal.\n\nFor two-wheelers, the policy could incentivise scrappage of vehicles older than 15 years with a net benefit of Rs 3,000-4,000 (comparing total potential benefit on scrapping vs resale value).\n\nHowever, the majority of two-wheelers do not have a life beyond 15 years and volumes (assuming scrappage over a three-year period) would account for only around 1-2 per cent of the five-year average annual new sales volume of around 185 lakh, according to Crisil Research.\n\nThe scrappage policy, therefore, will provide no significant lift to sales of two-wheeler manufacturers.\n\nIn medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs), though, the potential scrappage volume is significant, it is estimated that around 5.1 lakh MHCVs (>7.5 tonne gross vehicle weight segment) are older than 15 years and hence, could potentially be destined for the scrapyard.\n\nCrisil said it gauged the scrapping potential of around 18.5 tonne GVW medium commercial vehicles with a sticker price of Rs 18-19 lakh in Maharashtra (erstwhile 16.0 tonne GVW trucks) that are more than 15 and 20 years old.\n\nThis segment comprises around 20 per cent share of the 5.1 lakh CVs older than 15 years. The insights from this analysis are applicable to the other CV segments as well, it said, adding two scenarios have been reviewed to assess the benefits the scrappage policy will provide.\n\nIn the optimistic scenario, the potential benefit of scrapping a 15-year-old CV, and its resale value are similar. As the age of vehicle increases, the benefit reduces, while incentives increase. That's because, the resale value of a 20-year-old truck is less compared with a 15-year-old truck, so scrapping makes sense, according to the report.\n\nHowever, in the base case, the potential benefit is less than the resale value of the truck, so scrapping does not make sense, it added.\n\nAccording to Crisil, the financial burden after replacement increases significantly, hence even in its optimistic scenario, it does not see much traction for the policy from an incremental demand perspective.\n\nAlso, to boost scrapping volume, it was proposed by ministry of road transport and highways in January that the Centre should direct state governments to impose 10-25 per cent green tax on old vehicles at the time of renewal of a fitness certificate.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Linkedin EMail"}, {"Article Image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-82288457,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-62186,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "Article's Title": "Mohammed bin Salman: No plan to introduce income tax in Saudi Arabia", "Article's Text": "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman speaks during televised interview in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nDUBAI: Saudi Arabia 's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in televised remarks on Tuesday that the kingdom had no plans to introduce income tax and a decision last July to triple value-added tax to 15% was temporary.\n\nThe kingdom had tripled VAT to offset the impact of lower oil revenue on state finances in a move that had shocked citizens and businesses expecting more support from the government during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Raising VAT was a painful measure and I hate to hurt any Saudi citizen, but it is my duty to build Saudis a long-term sustainable future,\" the prince said in an interview aired on Saudi TV to mark the fifth anniversary of Vision 2030.\n\n\"Raising VAT to 15% is a temporary decision that will last one to five years and then it will go down to between 5% to 10%,\" he said.\n\nPrince Mohammed also said the kingdom aims to reduce unemployment to 11% this year.

Incredibly, an exception often allows insurance companies to check your credit even if you want nothing to do with them. As we learned, that exception meant that Progressive could help itself to my wife\u2019s file \u2014 which in turn helped someone pick the pocket of the State of New York and its taxpayers, like us.\n\nIn its wisdom, Progressive considered my wife responsible enough to warrant coverage. Fortunately for us, Mr. Pasternak was paying! The second page of our welcome packet said that \u201cthe authorization you gave for your first installment payment\u201d was to come from a bank account with his name on it.\n\nSo meet our new best friend. With a name like Shiran Pasternak, he was a quick internet search away. Was he the thief? We wondered. But if he was, he was doing a pretty good job of hiding it. Like my wife, he had a \u201cWelcome to Progressive\u201d package and notes from the state about a mysterious unemployment claim that he had never filed. (The bank account and routing numbers in his Progressive packet were identical to ours, but neither had any connection to institutions where any of us do our financial business. Because the numbers were truncated, it was impossible to figure out if they came from a third person or were made up.)\n\nOnce we put all of that together, Mr. Pasternak \u2014 coincidentally a former New York Times employee \u2014 breathed a sigh of partial relief up in Irvington, N.Y., and let me push forward finding out what had happened to all of us.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works.\n\nAutomobile insurers \u2014 even the ones you don\u2019t use \u2014 already know a lot about you. They share claims information among themselves to help weed out unprofitable or reckless customers who try to jump to another provider. They can also get access to your driver\u2019s license number, your current auto policy data, and the make and model of your vehicle. Often, they buy this information from states (which end up sending money right back out when the buyers are careless and unemployment fraud proliferates).\n\nThe insurers want to make applying for a policy as easy as possible. So once you start entering information, they like to help you along and fill in some of those blanks for you. For some unfortunate victims, it was as simple for the scammers as copying down the driver\u2019s license number that popped up, although it usually required more technical know-how."}, {"Article Image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/23/business/00iberdrola-1/00iberdrola-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "Article's Title": "The Exxon of Green Power: A Spanish Company and Its Boss Set Sky-High Goals", "Article's Text": "MADRID \u2014 In the winter of 2015, three directors of a Connecticut electric company met with a potential acquirer: a determined Spanish utility executive named Jos\u00e9 Ignacio S\u00e1nchez Gal\u00e1n, who surprised them with a bold vision for America\u2019s utility industry.\n\n\u201cHe was very clear then that he saw the U.S. as having enormous potential in renewable energy,\u201d said John L.

During that time, the I.R.S.\u2019s annual budget declined by 20 percent and its staff declined by 22 percent.

The high cost of quality day care and pre-K puts these services out of reach for many families, who may rely on informal networks of relatives and neighbors who are untrained in early education.\n\nExpanding access to pre-K has been particularly popular over the past decade in states and cities, including some with Republican governors. A large body of research shows that achievement gaps between poor and middle-class children emerge in the earliest years of childhood and are present on the first day of kindergarten. Administration officials contend that free, quality early childhood education can both help cash-strapped parents and build students\u2019 skills in ways that will help them become more productive workers.\n\nStill, there are major disagreements about how generous any expansion of pre-K should be.

India\u2019s growth to rebound 11% in 2021-22, Covid surge could hurt economic normalization", "Article's Text": "NEW DELHI: The Asian Development Bank ADB ) projects India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) will rebound strongly by 11.0% in fiscal year (FY) 2021-22 ending on March 31, 2022 due to continued economic recovery boosted by increased public investment, vaccine rollout, and a surge in domestic demand. The forecast assumes that vaccines are deployed extensively across the country and the second wave of the coronavirus disease ( Covid-19 ) pandemic is contained.In its latest Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2021, the Manila based ADB forecasts India\u2019s economic growth to moderate to 7.0% in FY2022 as base effects disappear. The economy is expected to have contracted by 8.0% in FY2020 in line with the government\u2019s second advance estimate. The IMF recently estimated the Indian economy to grow by 12.5% in the current financial year.\u201cIndia\u2019s economy faced its worst contraction in FY2020 due to the Covid-19 shock. With large government stimulus and the ongoing vaccination drive, we expect economic activity will continue its recovery started from the third quarter of FY2020 and rebound strongly in the current fiscal year with an uptick in domestic demand, especially in urban services,\u201d said ADB Country Director for India Takeo Konishi. \u201cThe government\u2019s boost to public investment through its infrastructure push, incentives for manufacturing, and continued support to boost rural incomes will support India\u2019s accelerated recovery.\u201dRisks to the outlook tilt to the downside. An uncertain pandemic trajectory with a prolonged second wave despite the vaccination push could affect India\u2019s economic normalization. The forecast, however, expects the economic impact of the second wave to be relatively muted compared to the first wave in line with global experience. Other downside risks include further tightening of global financial conditions on fast recovery in developed countries, which would apply pressure on India\u2019s market interest rates, a statement from ADB said.Economists say the sharp surge in Covid-19 vaccination and the localised lockdowns is expected to hurt growth and economic recovery underway may slowdown significantly.Economic activity will continue to normalize and recover, backed by government measures over the past year including a large stimulus in FY2020 and a steep increase in capital expenditure budget in FY2021 . Increased government expenditure on health care, water, and sanitation will strengthen the country\u2019s resilience against future pandemics. Private investment is expected to pick up on improving sentiment and risk appetite, as well as accommodative credit conditions.Domestic demand is expected to remain the main driver of growth. A faster vaccine rollout will boost urban demand for services, while the rural demand will be boosted by robust agriculture growth and continued government support to farmers by expanding irrigation, improving value chains, and increasing farm loan limits.Forecast of a normal monsoon and bumper harvest of summer crops will further boost the agriculture sector. The government\u2019s push to the manufacturing sector through the production-linked incentive scheme will expand domestic production and help integrate domestic manufacturing with global supply chains.Inflation, after rising to 6.2% in FY2020, is projected to moderate to 5.2% in FY2021 as good harvests and supply chain recovery contain domestic food inflation. Inflation is expected to ease further to 4.8% in FY2022 on moderating domestic demand as the economy returns to normal. This will help the central bank maintain an accommodative stance by ensuring ample liquidity and keeping long-term interest rates from rising.In FY2021, the current account deficit will equal to 1.1% of GDP with imports outpacing exports on rising domestic demand and higher oil prices. Exports and imports will grow moderately in FY2022 as global demand normalizes bringing down the current account deficit marginally to 1.0%.In FY2021, the fiscal deficit is budgeted to fall to the equivalent of 6.8% of GDP with capital spending rising sharply from revised expenditure in FY2020 by 26.2%.

Elaine Thompson/Associated Press Boeing said Wednesday that it lost $561 million in the first three months of the year as it emerged from its prolonged 737 Max crisis and contended with new problems related to the 787 Dreamliner jet. Revenue fell 10 percent to $15.2 billion compared with the same period last year. But, like his counterparts at major airlines, Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s chief executive, struck an optimistic tone. \u201cWhile the global pandemic continues to challenge the overall market environment, we view 2021 as a key inflection point for our industry as vaccine distribution accelerates and we work together across government and industry to help enable a robust recovery,\u201d he said in a statement. In an investor presentation, Boeing said it continued to expect the recovery to take years to unfold, with passenger traffic unlikely to return to 2019 levels until 2023 or 2024. It also said its financial results for this year \u201chinge\u201d on a recovery in the commercial airplane market. At the end of March, the company had a backlog of more than 4,000 commercial airplane orders, valued at $283 billion. Its defense and space backlog was valued at $61 billion.

The company also suffered a $318 million charge related to development of the next Air Force One, which was affected by a pandemic slowdown and problems with a key supplier, which Boeing recently sued. It was also the first full quarter since the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s decision in November to lift its ban on the 737 Max, which had been grounded globally nearly two years following two fatal crashes in which hundreds were killed. Since the ban was lifted, Boeing has delivered more than 85 Max\u2019s to customers worldwide. It also reported that it sold more planes than were canceled in February and March, its first months of positive sales in more than year. Nearly two dozen airlines have put the plane back into service on more than 26,000 flights, Boeing said. Mr. Calhoun also provided an update on an electrical concern with some Max planes that was disclosed this month. The F.A.A. has said the issue could affect the operation of a backup power control unit in 106 planes worldwide, all of which have been grounded.

The Fed has held interest rates near zero since March 2020. Credit... Stefani Reynolds for The New York Times The Federal Reserve is expected to keep its monetary policy in crisis mode when it concludes its latest meeting on Wednesday, even as the economy improves. The question is how long it will take for the recovery to progress enough to inspire the central bank to change course. The Fed has held interest rates near zero since March 2020, and is buying bonds at a pace of about $120 billion a month. Those policies make many types of borrowing cheap and push investors toward riskier, more active investments \u2014 sending money coursing through the economic system and speeding up growth. Fed officials are in no rush to dial back that support \u2014 even as coronavirus vaccines become widely available, the labor market heals and retail spending rises, helped along by government stimulus checks. Instead, central bankers, including the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, have been emphasizing that the economy remains far from fully healed. Millions are out of work and the coronavirus has not been fully contained in the United States or globally \u2014 threatening an uneven economic recovery and risking the spread of new variants. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee has said it wants to see \u201csubstantial\u201d progress toward its goals of full employment and stable inflation before slowing down the monthly bond purchases. The hurdle for rate increases is even higher: A return to maximum employment and inflation that exceeds 2 percent and is expected to slightly overshoot that for some time. At their meeting in March, the central bank\u2019s officials signaled that interest rates were likely to remain near-zero through 2023 if the economy shapes up as they expect. But investors will be keenly focused on hints about the path ahead when Mr. Powell gives a post-meeting news conference around 2:30 p.m., after the committee\u2019s 2 p.m. statement release. \u201cBy the time of the June meeting well over half of all Americans should be partially vaccinated, and the level of employment could be a few million greater than it is now, allowing the F.O.M.C. to discuss some tangibly improving outcomes,\u201d Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at J.P. Morgan, wrote in a research note. \u201cFor now, however, we think the message from the committee will be little changed from the one delivered six weeks ago.\u201d Still, the Fed\u2019s commitment to patience \u2014 an approach that focuses on real-world outcomes, not just expected ones \u2014 is in for its first big challenge. As unemployment drops and inflation picks up, two trends that are expected to play out in the coming months, monetary policymakers are likely to face growing calls to dial back their support to prevent conditions from getting out of hand. But Mr. Powell and his colleagues have played down concerns about overheating and inflationary warnings that hark back to the 1970s and 1980s, arguing that the world has changed in recent decades. \u201cWe had 3.5 percent unemployment, which is a 50-year low, for much of the last two years before the pandemic,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a recent \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. \u201cAnd inflation didn\u2019t really react much. That\u2019s not the economy we had 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s profit is its best in seven years. Deutsche Bank\u2019s best quarter in seven years was a vindication for Christian Sewing, the chief executive who took over in 2018. Credit... Ralph Orlowski/Reuters Deutsche Bank reported its best quarterly profit in seven years Wednesday as it benefited from lively financial markets and avoided losses from the investment firm Archegos Capital that has battered rivals. The first-quarter profit of 900 million euros, or $1.1 billion, was better than expected and suggested that Deutsche Bank may be emerging from a decade of scandals and disasters that earned it a reputation as Europe\u2019s most troubled lender. James von Moltke, the chief financial officer of Deutsche Bank, said in response to a question about Archegos during an interview with Bloomberg News that the bank had been able to exit its involvement without a loss. That is in contrast to rivals like Credit Suisse, which lost $4.7 billion it had lent to Archegos after the firm collapsed in March. Swiss bank UBS disclosed Tuesday that it lost $774 million from its involvement with Archegos. Deutsche Bank, like most big corporations, is assessing how the pandemic may have permanently changed the way employees do their jobs. Mr. von Moltke said the bank was working on a plan that would allow employees to work from home two or three days a week. Like many of its peers, Deutsche Bank has benefited from frenetic activity on financial markets, earning fees as it helped governments issue debt to finance stimulus programs or sell shares in blank-check investment vehicles known as SPACs. The bank said it had also benefited from a European Central Bank stimulus program that effectively pays commercial lenders to provide credit to businesses and consumers in the eurozone. In addition, Deutsche Bank slashed the amount of money it set aside for bad loans. The financial results are a vindication for Christian Sewing, the bank\u2019s chief executive, who has been trying to show large shareholders like the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management that he can generate consistent profits. Deutsche Bank shares rose 9 percent in Frankfurt trading Wednesday and are up more than 20 percent since the end of January. \u201cOur first quarter is further evidence that Deutsche Bank is on the right path,\u201d Mr. Sewing said in a statement.\n\nA key question: How much inflation is too much? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Credit... Pool photo by Susan Walsh When Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, speaks to reporters in a webcast news conference on Wednesday afternoon, he\u2019s likely to face questions about a simmering topic: inflation. Prices are expected to pop in the coming months, both as inflation indexes lap very weak 2020 readings and as supply chains experience short-term reopening bottlenecks. The unknowns facing the Fed, and the investment world, are how big the jump will be and how long it will last. Most forecasters and the Fed itself expect the increases to be only temporary. But some economists have warned that they could be significant enough to become a problem as businesses reopen, consumers start to spend their savings and the government pumps stimulus money into the economy. If the increases are big enough and sustained, the Fed could find itself in a tough spot, forced to choose between letting prices rise or raising interest rates before the labor market is fully recovered. Inflation also worries stock investors: If the Fed lifts interest rates to cool off the economy, it could make investing in bonds more attractive and corporate borrowing more expensive, both bad news for equities. The Fed wants inflation to average 2 percent annually over time, and it defines that goal using the Commerce Department\u2019s headline personal consumption expenditure index. But officials look at a variety of indicators to gauge conditions. Here\u2019s where a handful of critical inflation measures stand and, when it\u2019s relevant, where economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect them to go in the coming months: P.C.E., the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge: 1.6 percent in February, and expected at 2.3 percent in March and 2.2 percent for the full year.\n\nCore P.C.E., which strips out volatile food and energy prices: 1.4 percent in February, and expected at 1.8 percent in March and 1.9 percent for the full year.\n\nConsumer Price Index, an important Labor Department gauge: 2.6 percent in March and expected at 2.6 percent for the full year.\n\nProducer Price Index, a measure of wholesale prices: 4.2 percent in March, the highest since 2011.\n\nUniversity of Michigan consumer inflation expectation for next year: 3.7 percent as of this month, up from 3 percent at the start of the year.\n\nUniversity of Michigan consumer inflation expectation for five years from now: 2.7 percent as of this month, little changed from start of the year.\n\nFive-year, five-year forward inflation expectation rate, a market-based measure: 2.25 percent in recent days, roughly matching 2018 levels. Fed officials regularly point out that inflation has been too tepid in recent years, not too high, and they don\u2019t expect that to change quickly. To raise rates, they say, they would need to see that inflation was going to remain higher sustainably \u2014 for instance, if it came alongside heftier wage increases. Part of the Fed\u2019s comfort with a period of faster price gains is that consumer and business expectations have remained relatively low, despite some recent increases. If people aren\u2019t anticipating higher prices, it\u2019s likely to put a lid on how much more companies can charge.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBond yields rise before the Fed\u2019s policy decision.

Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters Government bond yields jumped on Wednesday ahead of the latest Federal Reserve policy meeting. Economists expect Fed officials to keep interest rates near zero and continue their bond-buying program, but central bank watchers will be looking for clues for how much longer the support will last as the U.S. economy improves. Higher yields on government bonds may reflect expectations that the Fed is inching closer signaling that it will change its policy, including raising its benchmark rate, even if that\u2019s still years in the future. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will speak to reporters Wednesday afternoon. Fed officials have said they would telegraph any changes well in advance and expected the current rise in inflation to be temporary, which would diminish the need for a monetary policy reaction. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes as high as 1.65 percent on Wednesday. Yields on British and German government bonds also climbed. \u201cWe think risks around this meeting are firmly skewed toward higher rates,\u201d analysts at ING said of bond yields. \u201cThis is particularly true if the Fed breaks with its cautious tone of late, or simply decides to hedge its bets by saying it will react as appropriate if the economy overheats.\u201d Stocks The S&P 500 opened slightly higher on Wednesday.\n\nDeutsche Bank rose nearly 9 percent after the German bank reported its best quarterly profit in seven years.

Not without reason. The two-wheeler company\u2019s March quarter (Q4FY21) results, announced after market hours on Tuesday, have surprised the Street positively, especially on the profit margin front.\n\nThe company\u2019s standalone earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) margin expanded by around 60 basis points vis-\u00e0-vis the December quarter to 10.1%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. On a year-on-year basis, Ebitda margin has improved by 304 basis points. According to Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, TVS Motor\u2019s Ebitda per vehicle increased by 12% sequentially and this measure, along with Ebitda margin were both at an all-time high.\n\nThe upshot: Ebitda for the March quarter has increased by 119% to Rs536 crore. This on the back of about 53% year-on-year revenue growth to Rs5,322 crore, which was helped by 46% sales volume growth. A combination of price hikes, better product mix (higher exports) and cost control initiatives have helped the company\u2019s operating performance. It\u2019s also worth noting that this comes at a time when investors are worried about the adverse impact of higher raw material cost pressures on profit margins for auto firms. Against this backdrop, TVS Motor\u2019s performance is encouraging for investors.\n\nThe company\u2019s March quarter results have prompted many analysts to upgrade their earnings estimates for financial year 2022 and financial year 2023.\n\nTo be sure, the road ahead is not particularly smooth. For one, the second covid-19 wave is expected to weigh on auto demand. TVS Motor management told analysts that it expects covid-19 lockdowns to impact demand in the June quarter. Further, higher commodity costs continue to be a worry for auto companies, which means investors will closely watch how margins shape up in the near future.\n\nIn general, analysts reckon TVS Motor would be able to cope with these challenges effectively. Analysts from Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd said in a report on 28 April, \u201cWith industry-beating growth in the domestic two-wheeler market continuing, along with stronger growth in exports, the rising profitability trajectory would result in around 53% earnings CAGR in FY21-FY23E.\" CAGR is compound annual growth rate.\n\nJefferies\u2019 analysts said in a report on 27 April, \u201cNotwithstanding near-term covid issues in India, we expect a synchronized demand recovery in domestic and export markets driving strong 14%/13% volume growth for TVS in FY22/FY23.\"\n\nThe only hitch is that the stock\u2019s sharp appreciation on Wednesday suggests investors are capturing a good portion of the optimism and earnings recovery. Currently, TVS Motor\u2019s shares trade at around 29 times estimated earnings for financial year 2022, based on Jefferies\u2019 data.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/35719c1d03e140f9aa95fab637ca8050-35719c1d03e140f9aa95fab637ca8050-0_1619589002395_1619589020416.jpg", "Article's Title": "Record defaults are clouding India\u2019s stock, bond markets", "Article's Text": "Credit markets are sounding warnings for other asset classes amid India\u2019s unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. Firms have defaulted on at least 57 billion rupees ($763 million) of domestic bonds this year, the most on record for a similar period. Traders expect more. They\u2019ve pushed spreads on A rated local corporate bonds over AAA notes to a 17-year high, a grim sign for the small businesses that tend to have those weaker ratings and that form the bedrock of the $2.7 trillion economy.\n\nThat all suggests the need for further caution in the equities and government bond markets, which have held up better despite volatility. While the defaults are largely among smaller, often unlisted borrowers, they add to challenges for policy makers already grappling with one of the world\u2019s worst bad debt ratios. On top of that, the Covid outbreak risks fanning inflation as local curbs disrupt supply chains, threatening to limit central bank options for juicing the economy.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t expect there will be good news on the economy, good news on earnings and stock prices will go up,\" said Sunil Subramaniam, managing director of Sundaram Asset Management Co. \u201cIt is undoubtedly, going to be a volatile period for the market.\"\n\nEquities\n\nIn recent days, equity and government bond investors have focused on more optimistic signals as the government has refrained from broad national lockdowns. India\u2019s S&P BSE Sensex Index rose to a three-week high Tuesday after a U.S. decision to offer vaccine support, and continued up Wednesday.\n\nBut there have been mounting concerns. Despite the recent rally, Indian stocks are lagging their Asian peers this month after outperforming for four straight quarters.\n\nAnd while some long-term investors including Fidelity International and Invesco have said they are seeking opportunities to add stocks, sentiment broadly has soured among global equity funds. Foreign investors sold a net $1.2 billion of Indian shares this month through April 26, on course for the worst outflow since March 2020.\n\nIndia\u2019s central bank was able to tame yields with its announcement of a QE-like bond buying program earlier this month. That\u2019s sent the yield on the benchmark 10-year sovereign bond down about 12 basis points in April, set for the biggest retreat in six months. The rupee has rebounded in the past few days as well, coming off its weakest against the dollar since August earlier this month.\n\nBut yields have been volatile, with traders nervous about the possibility of more government spending to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has raised the possibility of bringing forward planned borrowing.\n\nJitters about the supply of government notes have already resulted in underwriters being forced to rescue bond auctions and the central bank having to cancel some.\n\nMeanwhile, concerns about the economic impact from the Covid resurgence have left the rupee down about 2.1% in April against the dollar despite the recent rally, set for the worst drop since March last year.\n\nThe corporate bond market has been flashing other red lights.\n\nCredit-default swaps for State Bank of India -- considered a proxy for India\u2019s default risk -- widened to a 9-month high this week, before dropping back Tuesday after the news about the U.S. vaccine assistance, CMA data show.\n\n\u201cMarkets are getting cautious on the credit side as economic growth is seen slowing down, raising concerns distressed debt may rise,\" said Vikas Goel, managing director and chief executive officer at PNB Gilts Ltd.\n\nSBI Funds Management Pvt., India\u2019s biggest asset manager, has said they are watchful on the financial sector as relief announced by authorities such as a debt moratorium has hidden the true picture of the stress the pandemic has exerted.\n\nAcross industries, some borrowers are finding it harder to tap the credit market. Issuance of local-currency notes graded A and below fell to a 10-year low of 1.8 billion rupees in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Ebitda is short for earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.\n\nShares of the company rose around 2% on the NSE in Tuesday's opening trade reacting to its Q1 earnings. The company follows calendar year as financial year.\n\nABB India's strong performance in Q1FY21 was aided by lower employee costs and other expenses. On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis these components declined by 6% and 25%, respectively. Consequently, operating margins for the quarter stood at 8.1%, as compared to 1% in the same quarter last year.\n\nOf course, a favourable base has aided this steep surge. Analysts say, the steep decline in \"other expenses\" is a positive surprise, however with business normalcy resuming, investors should brace for a reversal here. Investors would reckon that in their December quarter earnings call, the company's management had said that the benefits of their cost optimisation measures had reached a peak.\n\n\"Ebitda came in 29% above our expectation with margin rising 210 bps q-o-q (quarter-on-quarter) and highest since 4QCY18.

We would seek clarity on the call on key drivers behind low other expenses and sustainability of this ratio going forward,\" analysts at Ambit Pvt. Ltd said in a note. ABB India analysts' call is scheduled today post market hours.\n\nThe company's order inflows declined by 7% y-o-y to \u20b91,830 crore in Q1CY21 and the current order book stands at \u20b94,330 crore. According to analysts, Q1 is seasonally a strong quarter and weak order inflows is a concern in coming quarters as second covid wave impact plays out.\n\nMeanwhile, its parent company, which announced earnings on Monday, said that it will be separating its e-mobility division from the electrification segment. Investors need to monitor if this development will have an impact on ABB India.\n\nOn the valuation front, analysts estimates show that the stock is trading at one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 64 times. This is premium to peers Siemens and Honeywell Automation. Some analysts are of the view that Honeywell Automation is better placed than ABB India and Siemens, given that the company is pure play in the automation segment.

To expand their reach beyond leading cities, some digital brokers have offerings in regional content as well, apart from multiple trading platforms including some that deploy algorithmic trading strategies.\n\nTiwari also said that a majority of new clients are relatively young, who are looking to diversify their investments and income streams.

In a call with analysts after the results, Rajeev Jain, Bajaj Finance managing director, said that increasing average daily business volume, along with collections, gives them this confidence.\n\n\u201cAs a high-frequency indicator, in the last 7-10 days, the company has continued to originate 50-55% of daily volumes in B2B business, 80-85% in B2C and SME business and 40-50% in mortgages,\" he added.\n\nThat said, the company\u2019s presentation adds a caveat: \u201cBarring a national lockdown, three-four large GDP-contributing states going into simultaneous lockdown for three-five weeks and another moratorium on loan repayment, the company is confident of delivering its long-term guidance metrics in FY22.\"\n\nSimply put, there is no way Bajaj Finance can escape the impact of the second wave, although the firm is better prepared in terms of operations than it was last year.\n\nBut there is some succour for investors on its asset quality. While headline numbers may have increased, the underlying stress and potential stress seem manageable. The lender\u2019s gross bad loan ratio rose to 1.79% from 1.61% in the previous quarter.\n\nBajaj Finance\u2019s restructuring loan pile was just \u20b91,739 crore, against which the lender has made adequate provisioning. Write-offs were lower than last quarter. Moreover, the lender has increased provisioning to cover for pandemic risks, apart from existing bad loans. A key pressure point for the company seems to be its auto loans. The biggest stress pile was in auto loans, where the gross bad loan ratio was 9.3%. This segment also saw the third-highest restructuring loan pile.\n\nBajaj Finance has been on the mend over the past two quarters in terms of both loan growth and asset quality. But the second covid wave threatens this improvement.\n\nWhile the management remains optimistic of its prospects, going ahead, it remains to be seen whether investors would give a boost to its valuations in a hurry. The company\u2019s stock has underperformed the broad Nifty index in the past one month, hinting at the concerns investors have.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/2021-04-28T051058Z_1412390562_RC2T4N9UK7DD_RTRMADP_3_USA-FED_1619613709283_1619613745464.JPG", "Article's Title": "Fed likely to keep rates near zero as recovery picks up", "Article's Text": "Federal Reserve officials are wrapping up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday at which they are likely to maintain ultralow interest rates to support the economy\u2019s accelerating recovery.\n\nThe central bankers have noted in public comments the recent pickups in hiring, spending and inflation, but have signaled no readiness to consider changing the Fed\u2019s key policies.\n\nThe Fed has held overnight interest rates near zero since March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic and related restrictions delivered a severe blow to the economy. Since June, the central bank has also been purchasing at least $80 billion of Treasury bonds and at least $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities to hold down longer-term borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.\n\nFed officials have said they would hold rates steady until the labor market is back to full strength and inflation has reached the central bank\u2019s goal of averaging 2%. Chairman Jerome Powell has said those conditions are unlikely to materialize this year, and most Fed officials indicated last month that they expect to hold off on raising rates until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nThey also say they want to see the economy make \u201csubstantial further progress\" toward their goals of maximum employment and 2% average inflation before starting to reduce the pace of bond purchases. Mr. Powell clarified recently that officials are measuring the economy\u2019s evolution since December, when the Fed first issued that guidance.\n\nThe economy has picked up steam in recent months as vaccination rates have risen, business restrictions have eased and the latest round of federal stimulus money has fueled spending. Consumer confidence rose in April to the highest level in 14 months, the Conference Board said Tuesday.\n\nEconomists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect hiring and inflation data to remain strong in the months ahead as the vaccination campaign advances, pushing economic growth to its fastest pace since 1983.\n\nFed officials have stressed that they want to see progress show up in economic data, rather than in forecasts, before they raise rates or scale back the bond purchases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just in the beginning stages of seeing these good data,\" San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly told reporters on April 16. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need repeated months of this before we can distinguish optimism about the future from the realization of the future.\"\n\nAs more evidence of a speedy economic recovery emerges, officials will likely begin outlining when and how they expect to ratchet down the Fed\u2019s bond purchases. Mr. Powell has said he wants to give plenty of advance warning ahead of such a shift.\n\nHis challenge will be to communicate the pivot while minimizing disruptions to financial markets.\n\nThe last time the Fed signaled a reduction in asset purchases, in 2013, it sparked a bond-market selloff known as the \u201ctaper tantrum.\" An ensuing spike in Treasury yields jolted Fed officials who worried they might undermine the economy\u2019s recovery from the 2007-09 recession.\n\nIn contrast to that time period, the economy is now widely expected to recover faster. Yields on U.S. government bonds and certain derivatives suggest investors believe the Fed will be able to start raising rates by 2023, sooner than most central-bank officials have indicated.\n\nThis story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/27/600x338/2020-05-24T105818Z_1_LYNXMPEG4N0AK_RTROPTP_3_MARUTI-SUZUKI-IN-JOBS_1594546776242_1619550559110.JPG", "Article's Title": "Maruti\u2019s margins shrink further in Q4; road ahead may not be smooth", "Article's Text": "This calendar year has begun on a rough note for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. The company\u2019s shares have declined as much as 20% from their 52-week high in January on the National Stock Exchange. Not without reason. The second covid-19 wave brings uncertainty as far as demand is concerned. Plus, investors are worried about the hit to profit margins, owing to rising cost pressures.\n\nThe automaker announced its March quarter results on Tuesday and analysts are disappointed about the firm\u2019s profit margins, in particular. Ebitda margin for the quarter stood at 8.3%, down 120 basis points compared with the December quarter. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.\n\nView Full Image Satish Kumar/Mint\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is due to higher raw material cost and the lag effect of price hikes to pass on cost escalation,\" said Mitul Shah, head of research at Reliance Securities. \u201cIt seems that the company\u2019s price hikes so far haven\u2019t been sufficient to pass on the full cost escalation to customers, as the demand environment is weak, coupled with higher competitive intensity,\" he added.\n\nSequentially, Maruti\u2019s Ebitda declined about 11% to \u20b91,991 crore. For perspective: analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities had estimated Ebitda at \u20b92,264 crore, assuming profit margins will hold at Q3 levels of 9.5%. Maruti had fallen far short of the Street\u2019s estimates on margins in Q3 as well.\n\nThe company\u2019s net profit declined by 10% year-on-year to \u20b91,166 crore. A Bloomberg poll of analysts had estimated Maruti\u2019s net profit at \u20b91,699 crore. Of course, another reason for this miss is the sharp drop in other income due to mark-to-market losses on invested surplus.\n\nFor the March quarter, Maruti\u2019s operating revenues, though, have increased by 32% over the same period last year to \u20b924,024 crore. The company sold 492,235 vehicles last quarter, which is a near 28% increase year-on-year. Out of this, domestic volumes at 456,707 units increased by 26.7% year-on-year while export volumes increased by 44% year-on-year.\n\nTrue, a favourable base helped as last year\u2019s March quarter saw a considerable drop in sales volumes, largely owing to the covid-19 lockdown. Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd\u2019s calculations show that the company\u2019s average selling price has risen 4.5% year-on-year and 4% sequentially.\n\nAfter a lacklustre March quarter, the journey ahead will not be smooth. As mentioned earlier, near-term margin pressures are a worry. Investors will also closely watch the impact on demand of the second covid wave.\n\nCompetitive intensity is also rising. These factors are likely to weigh on sentiments for the stock from a near-term perspective. So far this calendar year, Maruti\u2019s shares have declined by 14% compared to a 5% gain in the broader Nifty 100 index. However, from a medium-term perspective increasing consumer preference for personal mobility and rising affordability augur well for demand.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/21d6b124-4aa5-11eb-b097-bed98ba4ca79_1612443872815_1619577986719.jpg", "Article's Title": "Markets likely to consolidate; Axis Bank, Info Edge in focus", "Article's Text": "Mumbai: Indian stock markets are likely to consolidate on Wednesday, while trends in SGX Nifty suggests a flat to positive opening for domestic benchmark indices.

In the case of Zomato, gross order value in the December 2020 quarter has only about inched back to pre-pandemic levels. But the good news for its investors is that the contribution margin has turned positive.\n\nIn the first nine months of financial year 2021 (9MFY21), Zomato reported a contribution margin of Rs22.9 per order, compared with a loss of Rs30.5 per order in FY20. This excludes costs associated with marketing, branding and other fixed operating costs. Still, the contribution margin had been on the mend even before the pandemic, and has turned positive since the first quarter of FY21.\n\nView Full Image\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast improvement in unit economics will be a key factor used in promoting the IPO, although investors should note that some of the benefits to the food delivery business post-covid may not sustain. Already the contribution margin has tapered a bit in Q3, falling by a third, compared with Q2 levels.\n\nWhile the company hasn\u2019t provided a quarterly break-up of its results, a comparison of unit economics of 9MFY21 and fiscal 2020 shows that the improvement in profitability was driven by higher fees and lower discounts.\n\nView Full Image\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage order value rose over 40% to nearly Rs400, driving an increase in commission earned on a per order basis. The company also increased delivery charges billed to customers. In FY20, only 30% of actual delivery costs were billed to customers. This was increased to 60% in FY21. Another major saving came in the form of lower discounts. On a per order basis, discounts were cut to merely a third of FY20 levels.\n\nWhile Zomato did well on costs, it hasn\u2019t seen the rapid growth reported by some global firms such as Doordash. Gross order value stood at Rs2,981 crore in the December 2020 quarter, up 7% year-on-year. In the case of Doordash, which had a blockbuster IPO last year, revenues had more than trebled in the December 2020 quarter.\n\nView Full Image\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US firm\u2019s losses have also magnified, showing that Zomato has preferred a cautious approach, with the main focus being on unit economics. Total orders received by the Indian firm were still 23% lower in the December quarter compared with pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis is surprising, as it was felt that restrictions on eating out had led to an increase in food delivery orders. Higher delivery fees and lower discounts could partly be blamed for the drop in the number of orders. In other words, discounts will still play a big role for driving growth.\n\nIn this regard, Zomato appears to be well placed in terms of its cash position. In FY20, it had a cash balance of just Rs500 crore or so. This has risen to around Rs6,700 crore after large fundraising rounds ahead of the IPO, besides which another Rs7,500 crore will be raised through the IPO.\n\nView Full Image\n\nWhile cash burn has reduced meaningfully in 9MFY21 to Rs272 crore (versus Rs2,165 crore in FY20), the high cash balance may well prompt another round of discounting to drive growth. The fact that a number of private equity investors are staying put and aren\u2019t selling in the IPO suggests they are in for the long haul as well.\n\nInfo Edge (India) Ltd is the only selling shareholder in the IPO, and isn\u2019t exactly cashing out. It will be selling only around 10% of its holding for Rs750 crore. Its cost of acquisition on a per share basis was merely Rs1.16, and the last round of fundraising in February pegged the firm\u2019s value at Rs58.2 per share. At Zomato\u2019s most recent valuation, Info Edge will stay invested with a stake valued as high as Rs6,500 crore.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/4ec850a8-a76f-11eb-af25-752eabb3bc71_1619587266477_1619588208072.jpg", "Article's Title": "Axis Bank\u2019s Q4 cheers, but high contingent provisions raise eyebrows", "Article's Text": "If anything is about to go wrong, it will go wrong. Perhaps this Murphy\u2019s Law is what Axis Bank believes in, although its March quarter performance has given enough reasons for investors to expect better days ahead.\n\nThe private sector lender reported a sequential fall in its gross bad loan ratio, and its restructuring loan pile was less than 1% of the total portfolio. Fresh slippages for the March quarter at \u20b95,285 crore, which analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd termed as marginally higher than expected. The management\u2019s commentary showed optimism on the outlook notwithstanding the threat from the second wave of the pandemic.\n\nWhat seems to have raised eyebrows among investors is the huge pile of provisioning that the lender has made against the pandemic related risks. As of March, Axis Bank held \u20b912,000 crore as contingency provisions over and above that of existing bad loans. As such, its provisioning coverage ratio is high at 72%. Analysts have viewed this large provisioning buffer as a positive in terms of profitability in the coming quarters. While only time will tell whether the lender\u2019s provisions would give enough power to the lender to ride out the second wave impact, a peer comparison shows Axis Bank in better light.\n\nBut a move to keep provisions high cuts both ways. Perhaps investors also view this as an overly cautious approach in the wake of the second wave. The question being asked is does Axis Bank know about risks that other lenders are not seeing. Despite the net profit beat, the lender\u2019s shares were trading weak in early trade today.\n\nThat said, its provisions keep Axis Bank in a sweet spot. If the pandemic results in increased stress, the lender has the necessary insurance against it and in the advent of such risks not materialising, the lender can write back these provisions as profit. Ergo, most analysts have increased their earnings per share estimates for the bank. \u201cAxis Bank has delivered a strong performance and appears well-positioned to report robust earnings traction. Moreover, moderation in fresh slippages, coupled with improved underwriting and an increasing retail mix, would help maintain strong credit cost control,\" wrote analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.\n\nWhile the net profit was boosted largely due to a sequential fall in provisioning, a healthy 11% growth in core interest income also supported. Shares of the lender have hardly gained in the past one month, but have outperformed that of the sector index because of the latter\u2019s more than 3% fall.\n\nShare Via\n\nSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.livemint.com/img/2021/04/28/600x338/mutual-khTD--621x414@LiveMint_1619574157476.jpg", "Article's Title": "Stocks to Watch: Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance, Britannia, Info Edge, TVS Motor", "Article's Text": "NEW DELHI: Here are the top 10 stocks that could be in news today:\n\nAxis Bank: The private sector lender expects collections to slow down in the coming weeks as infections continue to rise, impacting movement of executives on the ground, its chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry said on Tuesday.

For many, their interests include investing in a certain standard of living that involves a healthy dose of self-care, recreation and travel. In the process, the quality of health often takes a backseat. But after the coronavirus pandemic, a majority of millennials are opting for health insurance to protect themselves, their family, and finances. They are now waking up to the benefits of having a health plan to cover the risk of a breadwinner succumbing suddenly to the virus.\n\nFor instance, in September, TransUnion, a global information and insights company, surveyed more than 3,000 people who had visited a healthcare facility in the past year and found that the younger generations were feeling the greatest impact from the pandemic. The survey highlighted that 33 per cent of Gen Z - those born after 1996 until 2010 - and 29 per cent of millennial respondents had their health insurance impacted by the pandemic. David Wojczynski, president of TransUnion Healthcare, said healthcare consumerism was growing partly because of the economic challenges resulting from the pandemic.\n\nCloser home, when Max Bupa Health Insurance conducted a survey in India, it found that it was not just people in the age group of 35 and about, but also millennials who were increasingly curious to understand health coverage and invest in it.\n\nThis interest is significant in a country, where according to experts, 80 per cent of the population still does not have any significant health insurance and 68 per cent has only limited or no access to essential medicines.\n\nAt over 42 crore, millennials account for 34 per cent of India's population and any impact on their savings could result in a ripple effect. Here are some factors that millennials should consider to understand why it could be a wise thing to invest in a health cover:\n\nTo support medical costs and extend protection to your family.\n\nTo boost your savings. Health insurance policies offer good returns when they mature.\n\nHealth covers are great as a tool for retirement planning.\n\nIn the current times, many medical insurance providers offer a cashless facility with their policies under certain conditions. This is a huge advantage to have during an emergency, where the insurer pays for eligible expenses directly to the institution, and the customers do not feel the pressure of making arrangements for immediate cash requirements.\n\nBesides covering health emergencies, these policies can also provide tax relief.\n\nPandemic or not, investing in health insurance across age groups is the need of the hour."}, {"Article Image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-04/89p1i5a8_drdo-oxygen_625x300_19_April_21.jpg", "Article's Title": "Covid-19 Pandemic: DRDO To Set Up 500 Oxygen Plants In Three Months", "Article's Text": "DRDO to set up 500 oxygen plants in three months\n\nResponding to the Centre's call to all state-owned companies across sectors to produce and distribute oxygen, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Wednesday announced that it will set up 500 medical oxygen generating plants across the country within three months under the PM-CARES fund.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the Defence Ministry, the technology for medical oxygen plant developed by DRDO for on-board oxygen generation for light combat aircraft Tejas, has now been transferred to Tata Advanced Systems Limited, Bengaluru, and Trident Pneumatics Pvt Ltd, Coimbatore, for setting up the plants.\n\nThese entities will be producing 380 of the 500 plants for installation across various hospitals in the country, the defence ministry statement said.\n\nThe remaining 120 plants will be produced by the industry in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun, it added.\n\nThe oxygen generation plants can produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute."}, {"Article Image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2018-12/ij20md5c_sensex-nifty-share-market-stock-market_625x300_18_December_18.jpg", "Article's Title": "PNB Housing Finance Gains After Reporting Profit Of Rs 127 Crore In March Quarter", "Article's Text": "PNB Housing Finance was last trading 0.03 per cent higher at Rs 377 on the BSE.\n\nShare price of PNB Housing Finance gained around one per cent on Wednesday, April 28, a day after the company reported a net profit of Rs 127 crore in the January-March quarter of the financial year 2020-21.

Benzema led the resistance, one shot from distance shaving the post before another from close drew Madrid level.\n\nA short corner worked its way to Marcelo on the edge of the area and his cross was headed back in via Casemiro and Eder Militao. Benzema, with his back to goal and surrounded by blue shirts, tamed the ball with his forehead before throwing his body into the air and volleying in before his markers could react.\n\nMarcelo and Jorginho were both guilty of sloppy passes early in the second half but neither Werner nor Benzema could capitalise.\n\nAnd for 20 minutes the game drifted, both sides nervous of opening up. Four substitutes came on just after the hour, Hazard and Kai Havertz among them.\n\nHazard was making his third appearance in three months.\n\nBut Benzema's shot was blocked, Hakim Ziyech's free-kick curled into the hands of Courtois and a late Madrid cross flashed past the far post.

Revulsion, at the insensitivity of continuing with a tournament amidst the pain and suffering in the country. And guilt at contributing, in whatever measure, to its profits by watching it on television.\n\nIt is easy to confuse IPL with sports, but it is in fact a highly leveraged television serial ideal for selling products where people happen to play a version of a popular game. And television is unlikely to put its golden goose to sleep. There is another month to go \u2014 a month when there will be more cases, more deaths and greater anxiety, all matched by the triumphalism and crassness of the tournament being played in a bubble \u2014 in more senses than one. What price the 78-metre six or the fast yorker that hits middle stump when around you people are dying in horrific ways and hope is being sucked out of so many lives?\n\nMeaningless activity\n\nSport is essentially a meaningless activity which we infuse with significance in normal times. Its artificiality allows us to pour into it the highest qualities we aspire to as human beings: compassion, honesty, fair-mindedness, kindness, respect, empathy, charity, everything that elevates us. But when it displays instead selfishness, indifference, and a lack of concern for the suffering of others, then it is no longer sport, but something that diminishes us.\n\nPublic celebration (admittedly in near-empty stadiums), pointless statistics and excited commentary make it all so surreal. Even the \u2018official\u2019 figures of the dead and suffering in India are frightening. Over a million people are affected every three days. These are now widely believed to be grossly under-counted. To adapt what Bob Dylan said all those years ago: How many deaths will it take till they know that too many people have died?\n\nHospitals are overcrowded, crematoriums too; there is a national medical emergency, yet \u2018maximums\u2019 are being hit on the cricket fields. There is something repugnant about this.\n\nTeams have arrived in the Capital \u2014 surely someone noticed during the drive from the airport that things aren\u2019t normal? That the smoke rising in the distance is not announcing the election of a new pontiff, but the desperation of citizens?\n\nDistraction\n\nThe yea-sayers will insist the IPL is a distraction in troubled times. Yes it is a distraction \u2014 from the ineptitude of the authorities who hope that if they close their eyes long enough, the situation will get better. In any case, neither the three-and-a-half lakh people who contract the virus daily nor their struggling families are likely to be interested how many deliveries Virat Kohli took for his latest fifty. Football, said the coach Bill Shankly, is not a matter of life and death, it is more serious. The IPL sees itself as more serious too.\n\nA friend sent me this prediction recently: \u201cAfter playing on and being absolutely silent through the suffering, once the IPL is done, the players and managements will talk of how their heart bleeds and how they will now generously open their purses, via a collective cheque handed over to PM and his fund by Ganguly (since Jay Shah will be too obvious), the pictures being discussed for hours on end in sections of the media, followed by tweets from Sachin, Virat, et al.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Pat Cummins became the first player known to make a donation, with 50,000 dollars towards oxygen supplies to hospitals in India. \u201cI encourage my fellow IPL players to contribute,\u201d he tweeted. It will be interesting to see how many will.\n\nIts own insurance\n\nSome players, most recently India\u2019s R. Ashwin, have pulled out, citing personal reasons. The Board of Control for Cricket in India does not see the IPL as a mere cricket tournament. It is a weapon to hold over the heads of players and other cricket boards. Displease the BCCI and there goes your income for the cricketing year! However much individual boards might like to recall their players during the crisis, it is unlikely any of them will do so. The players are only too aware which side their bread is buttered on, and grateful they can earn significant amounts of money when many avenues have dried up. The IPL is its own insurance.\n\nPerhaps if players like Kohli and Rohit Sharma decided to withdraw, there might be a cascading effect. But not everyone would want to take on the BCCI, so perhaps not.\n\nThe IPL has its place in the scheme of things. In normal times, you have the option of turning off the TV if you don\u2019t fancy it. But it\u2019s different now. Turning off the TV will not turn off the feeling of the inappropriateness of its rude health and larger-than-life images being beamed across homes in India when the country is struggling with both health and life."}, {"Article Image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/04/28/sports/28olympics-playbooks01/28olympics-playbooks01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "Article's Title": "Olympics Lays Out Ground Rules for Games: Daily Tests and Dining Restrictions", "Article's Text": "TOKYO \u2014 Athletes will be tested daily, but they will not need to quarantine.

India is facing an explosion of COVID-19 cases and the nation\u2019s health infrastructure has been severely strained dealing with lakhs of daily new cases.\n\n\u201cBe rest assured that the tournament is not over for BCCI till each one of you has reached your home, safe and sound,\u201d the Indian Board\u2019s COO Hemang Amin said on April 27 in a letter addressed to the players.\n\nAny such chartered flight would require the approval of the Australian government and Colbeck said no decision has been taken on this matter as yet.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any decisions that have been made yet with respect to [approval for a charter flight for] the cricketers,\u201d Colbeck told ABC radio.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons for the pause was to give our hotel quarantine a little bit of space because of the load we\u2019ve seen out of India,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a second wave of COVID-19 infections battered India, the Australian government on April 27 suspended air travel with the country besides asking players to make their \u201cown arrangements\u201d for return.\n\nEven before that announcement, the fear of being locked out drove the likes of Andrew Tye to take an early flight back to Australia along with Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa.\n\nMumbai Indians\u2019 Australian batsman Chris Lynn had also said that he hoped Cricket Australia to arrange a chartered flight for those who have stayed back.\n\nAs of now, the IPL still has 14 Australian players, including big names like Steve Smith (Delhi Capitals), David Warner (SunRisers Hyderabad) and Cummins.\n\nRicky Ponting (DC) and Simon Katich (Royal Challengers Bangalore) are among the high-profile Australian coaches, while iconic former players such as Matthew Hayden, Brett Lee and Lisa Sthalekar are part of the tournament\u2019s commentary team.\n\nThe ACA chief, however, said that the players will not ask for any preferential treatment and jump the queue if and when the Australian government evacuates its citizens from India. About 9,000 Australians are in India trying to return home.\n\n\u201cOne thing I can tell you is our players are under no expectations to look for specific favours,\u201d Greenberg said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no free rides or any expectations from our players. What they are looking for is the right information so they can plan accordingly.\n\nGreenberg said the majority of players feel \u201creally comfortable\u201d in the tournament\u2019s bio-security bubble and intend to finish their commitment.\n\nHowever, they remain understandably uneasy about what will happen beyond the final.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all pretty anxious. They\u2019re in one of the biggest hotspots we\u2019ve seen since COVID-19. They\u2019re very anxious about getting home at the end.\n\n\u201cBut also anxious about what a beautiful place India has been... and they\u2019re seeing such devastation.\u201d"}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/knghgu/article34421687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dhoni-Warner", "Article's Title": "IPL 2021, SRH vs CSK | Sunrisers Hyderabad opts to bat against Chennai Super Kings", "Article's Text": "SRH made two changes, bringing back Manish Pandey in place of Virat Singh and seamer Sandeep Sharma replacing Abhishek Sharma.\n\nDavid Warner-led Sunrisers Hyderabad opted to bat against Chennai Super Kings in the IPL match in New Delhi on Wednesday.\n\nSRH made two changes, bringing back Manish Pandey in place of Virat Singh and seamer Sandeep Sharma replacing Abhishek Sharma.\n\nFor CSK, Lungi Ngidi is back in the XI in place of Dwayne Bravo while all-rounder Moeen Ali comes in at the expense of Imran Tahir.\n\nThe Teams:\n\nSunrisers Hyderabad: David Warner (C), Jonny Bairstow, Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Vijay Shankar, Rashid Khan, Jagadeesha Suchith, Sandeep Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed and Siddarth Kaul.\n\nCSK: MS Dhoni (C), Ruturaj Gaikwad, Faf du Plessis, Moeen Ali, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, Shardul Thakur, Lungi Ngidi and Deepak Chahar."}, {"Article Image": "https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a3k1bo/article34430720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Wt20kb", "Article's Title": "COVID-19 surge | Women's T20 challenge unlikely to happen: BCCI sources", "Article's Text": "None of the Australian, English, South African or West Indies cricketers will be able to travel to India due to air travel restrictions\n\nThe three-team Women's T20 challenge, which is held during the IPL, is unlikely to go ahead this year given the current restrictions imposed by countries on air travel with India due to the massive spike in COVID-19 cases here.\n\nWhile the BCCI was planning a camp for the Indian women, the tournament has hit choppy waters as none of the Australian, English, South African or West Indies cricketers will be able to travel to India because of the unprecedented \"health crisis\".\n\n\"Getting Indian players quarantined is not an issue even now but no foreign player is keen to travel in the current climate.

The current purple cap holder, RCB's Harshal Patel (17 wickets) narrowly misses the cut for that category, being 30 years and 156 days old.Right behind Harshal on that list is 24 year old right arm fast medium bowler from Madhya Pradesh, Avesh Khan , who is playing for the Delhi Capitals .Avesh in fact was also part of India's 2016 Under-19 World Cup squad, which also had Rishabh Pant , his current IPL captain. The bonhomie between Pant and Avesh at Delhi Capitals is pretty evident. There is a sense of understanding between the two. For Avesh, Pant, who was included as a wicket-keeper batsman in the U-19 World Cup campaign and scored 267 runs in 6 outings at an average of 44.50, has come a long way and has matured like fine wine.\"Rishabh was aggressive since the under-19 days. His approach was different from others. He always wanted to win and do something different. His batting has always been an X-factor. Whenever he bats, there is pressure on the opposition team. He is a mature player now. He understands the game, situations and conditions well and he bats according to those,\" Avesh told Timesofindia.com in an exclusive interview.What Pant brings to the table as a batsman is no secret. Not only has he bounced straight back into the limited overs sides for India, he is also the number one contender for the wicket-keeper's position in Test cricket, after his exploits Down Under not too long ago.But what about Pant the captain? The 23 year old was handed the reins of the Delhi Capitals franchise at the last minute ahead of IPL 2021, because regular captain Shreyas Iyer injured his shoulder and was ruled out of the entire tournament.\"Rishabh is an aggressive captain. He is a bowler's captain. Whenever a captain is a bowler's captain, his team does well. Pant always backs his bowlers. Whenever a bowler leaks runs and is hit for boundaries, he (Pant) goes up to the bowler and speaks with him. He gives bowlers time. If he has to change any plan, he does it at that moment. Whenever the match starts to go in the favour of the opposition, he always comes forward and speaks with bowlers to break that momentum. He discusses the plans with the bowlers. This is his (Pant's) best quality,\" the Delhi Capitals pacer further said.Last season, Shreyas Iyer was in tremendous form for DC. He finished as the fourth highest run-getter overall, with 519 runs in 17 innings, with three fifties.Is the team badly missing Iyer this time?\"We are missing Iyer badly because he was our captain and was a vital cog in our batting lineup. It was unfortunate that he got injured. Injuries are part and parcel of a player's life. We are missing Iyer. Pant is our new captain and we want to win as many games under his leadership (as possible) and make it to the play offs and then the final. We will try our best to win the title this time,\" Avesh told TimesofIndia.com.Avesh himself has been grabbing a lot of headlines recently, thanks to his regular wickets this IPL season. He currently has 12 wickets in 6 matches, at an economy rate of 7.31. He is five wickets behind Harshal Patel.Avesh incidentally was also the highest wicket-taker for India in their 2016 u-19 World Cup campaign, with the exact same figures - 12 scalps in 6 matches.Playing DC's opening match of the season against Chennai Super Kings, Avesh claimed two big wickets.

MI are coming into the match after suffering back-to-back losses, the last one being a nine-wicket defeat against Punjab Kings in Chennai and need to start the Delhi leg afresh. The Sanju Samson-led Rajasthan have lost thrice in the tournament so far and will seek to build on the six-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders in the previous match.\n\nMumbai skipper Rohit Sharma (201 runs) has got starts but hasn't played a big knock and the Mumbaikar would be itching to get one as would be his opening partner Quinton De Kock (47 runs). But Mumbai's middle-order, which boasts of hard-hitting batsmen like Suryakumar Yadav (154 runs), Ishan Kishan (73 runs), Hardik Pandya (36 runs), Krunal Pandya (29 runs) and Kieron Pollard (65 runs), hasn't fired in unison so far.\n\nThe middle-order can pummel any good attack into submission on any given day and Sharma would hope for their batting to click on Thursday when the action shifts to the Feroz Shah Kotla ground. In the bowling department, pace duo of Trent Boult (6 wickets) and Jasprit Bumrah (4 wickets) have been exceptional, particularly at the death.\n\nLeg-spinner Rahul Chahar (9 wickets) and Krunal (3 wickets) have also been impressive and will again need to play their parts to perfection. Pollard is used as the fifth or the sixth bowler even as Hardik plays solely as a batsman. Mumbai, however, might play Adam Milne in place of Jayant Yadav.\n\nRajasthan, on the other hand, have a lot of issues to ponder over, particularly in the absence of key foreign players - Jofra Archer, Ben Stokes, Liam Livingstone and Andrew Tye. RR are yet to have a settled opening combination. They tried Manan Vohra (42 runs) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (22 runs) at the top but both failed to convert their starts.\n\nEnglishman Jos Buttler would need to score big to compliment his skipper Sanju Samson, who is the team's leading run-scorer (187) despite being inconsistent. And the likes Shivam Dube, David Miller and Riyan Parag, would have to support the top-order by chipping in with much-needed contributions.\n\nAll-rounder Chris Morris (9 wickets and 48 runs) has blown hot and cold and will again be under pressure to deliver his high price tag. Left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya (7 wickets) has been a revelation, while the experienced duo of Jaydev Unadkat (4 wickets) and Mustafizur Rahman (4 wickets) have been decent.\n\nThe three left-arm pacers along with Morris, however, need to be consistent. Leg-spinner Rahul Tewatia has got just one wicket from five games, while Shreyas Gopal, another leggie, has gone wicket-less in the two games he has played. Tewatia's role would be crucial if the Royals aim to contain the MI batting line-up, keeping in mind Amit Mishra's performance for Delhi.

But his strike rate of 117.14 also reflects the lethargy in the SRH batting.\n\nRashid Khan\n\nPromoted\n\nWherever he plays, Rashid Khan is always a key bowler, be it for Afghanistan or the slew of franchises he represents. But he too has been a little off the boil this time around.\n\nWith six wickets from five games, Rashid is as always quite stingy, averaging 5.60, but since SRH don't always pose a challenge in terms of the number of runs, rivals have learned to play the leggie out, something that Rashid will have to address."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/Untitled-design-14.jpg", "Article's Title": "Leicester\u2019s Wesley Fofana thanks EPL for allowing him to break fast mid-game", "Article's Text": "Leicester's Wesley Fofana runs during the English Premier League match between Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion at the King Power Stadium in Leicester, England, Thursday, April 22, 2021.

In the build up to his fourth Olympics, travel within India too has been a problem.\n\nHis mixed doubles partner Manika Batra had to travel to Chennai last week to train with him. The original plan was for him to practice at her training venue in Pune. The lockdown in Maharashtra resulted in change of plans\n\nAnd then, he says \u201cI don\u2019t know if (the Olympics) will happen.\u201d\n\nTraining and preparation has continued, yet amidst the uncertainty, he says this is the most confident he has been ahead of an Olympic Games.\n\n\u201cMy ranking does the talking for that,\u201d says the World No.32 during a SAI-organised press conference. \u201cThis is the best ranking I\u2019ve had going into an Olympics. In 2004 I was just entering the international field. In 2008 I first broke into the top 100. In 2016, I was just coming back from an injury and even the qualifying stage took a toll on my body.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been building up the confidence for the past few years. Bronze medals at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta certainly had a lot to do with it.\n\nSharath Kamal spearheaded the men\u2019s team to a bronze medal finish, the country\u2019s first Asian Games medal in the sport, beating a star-studded Japanese team along the way. A day later the 38-year-old paired up with Batra to pick up an unexpected bronze medal in the mixed doubles event, beating the South Korean World No.5 duo of Sangsu Lee and Jihee Jeon enroute.\n\nIt\u2019s in the mixed doubles event where India\u2019s biggest chance of a medal lies at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe main reason (for the confidence) is the medal we won at the Asian Games, where Manika and I were paired up for the first time,\u201d says Sharath, a TOPS-supported athlete.\n\n\u201cWe started to believe that if we can do it at the Asian Games, it can happen at the Olympics too. That is because Asia is the powerhouse of table tennis. The best teams are from here \u2013 China, Japan, South Korea. And then there are the subsidiaries of China \u2013 Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei and Singapore. When you can medal at the Asian Games, you have that confidence.\u201d\n\nThe Indian pair were in Doha over a month back, competing at a mixed doubles tournament where only the winner would earn one of the 16 spots available for the event in Tokyo. They overcame the Singaporean duo of Lin Ye and Pang Yew En Koen 4-2 in the semi-final before drawing up against the top seeded Korean team they had beaten in Jakarta.\n\nThey started slow, losing the first two sets before taking the next four to pull-off another famous win.\n\n\u201cThat gives us a lot of confidence and faith that this is going to be the best Olympic Games in terms of performance and results,\u201d he says.\n\nThe pair has continued to try and carry that momentum forward ever since. The recent training sessions in Chennai were the first part of many scheduled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to have at least five-six days of good practice every month where we completely focus on mixed doubles,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked on a lot of aspects and training is divided into a few parts. The first is to work on footwork and coordination, the second is a bit more tactical.\u201d\n\nThe contrasting styles make them an impressive pair.\n\n\u201cShe can slow down the game when needed, and I can speed it up. That way we can complement each other really well, and the opponent is not comfortable playing us. They want to finish the rally quickly, but we try to prolong the rally and make the opponent move much more than what they like,\u201d Sharath adds.\n\nHe puts vicious power and spin on the ball. Batra, with the long pimpled rubber on her backhand side \u2013 which she switches mid-rally \u2013 plays a deceptive game that can frustrate the toughest opponents. But the World No.62, the highest ranked women\u2019s player from India, also has a powerful forehand that makes a difference.\n\n\u201cWhen Sharath hits his forehand, he opens up the opponent,\u201d 2008 Olympian Neha Aggarwal had told The Indian Express. \u201cBut you need to have a partner who can hit the next shot with just as much power to finish off the rally. He\u2019s never had that kind of partner for a while. But Manika\u2019s new forehand complements his. She can match his intensity.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve been doing all they can amidst the chaos and uncertainty. With just 16 teams competing in the mixed doubles event, they need to win only three matches to secure a medal. The journey began for them three years ago, when the quietly confident pairing returned with India\u2019s first mixed doubles medal at the Asian Games. Now that the mixed event is making its debut at the Olympics, they hope to repeat their success."}, {"Article Image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/04/Liverpool-1.jpeg", "Article's Title": "Liverpool reports losses of $64M as pandemic takes effect", "Article's Text": "In March 2020, Liverpool announced a profit of 42 million pounds ($58 million), the fifth time in the previous six years the club had been in the black under its American ownership, Fenway Sports Group.
